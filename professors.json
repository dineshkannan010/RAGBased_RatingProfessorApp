            "I enjoyed being in her class (especially hearing the stories of my friends in the same class, with different teachers). The extra credit assignments were worth a lot of points and really helped to prepare for the tests. Her only downside is that her lectures went so fast, and I always needed help from my friends to do the homework.",
            "Got a C- in CH101... Panopto was all I needed. I realized how excellent + kind of a prof she is when I was able to process and understand the lectures on my own terms (she's fast). Very good at teaching. Very hard class. Not impossible though. The final replaces the lowest grade but the final is tough, I got a 77, which replaced test 3 (of 4).",
            "Mathematical essay tests, each of which you could earn extra credit for with a practice on WebAssign. One test will likely contain 3 chapters instead of 2. Practice tests, worksheets, and HWs are all good practice for exams. Rewatching lectures was also a must. Overall, difficult subject, but she did her best to make it easier.",
            "Petrovich is a great lecturer. Other than that, she goes through her lectures quick and does tophats for attendance. Tests are the majority of the grade, so if you do bad on them you will receive a low grade. Does not round final grades and does not curve.Extra credit assignments are difficult and contain a time limit. Rude person overall.",
            "Final replaces lowest midterm if it's better. Tophat questions graded on correctness, but she basically gives you the answers. All test questions were \"math essays.\" It's pretty much an applied math class. Participation: 6.67%, HW (10 + 1 EC): 20%, Midterms (4): 53.33%, Final: 20%",
            "Took me a while to get used to the way she taught math but she wasn't awful. She gives good resources to study... STUDY PRACTICE TEST. Did not realize she had one for the first exam and made a D, studied the practice test for the other exams, and made high Bs. (without trying on homework or paying attention in class which I recommend you do)",
            "Dr. Petrovich for sure knows what she's doing, but I feel as though she goes too fast and rushes through material, hence making lectures difficult to follow. Her tests are well-made and not terrible, but you really need to study everything in the required chapters for the test to make sure she doesn't surprise you with anything. Do practice tests!",
            "She is a great professor who teaches an insanely difficult freshman weed-out. I suck at math, so this class has been rough for me. However, she offers lots of extra credit and is a very nice lady. If you put in the work outside of class, you will be fine.",
            "Hard class, she makes it as easy as she can. Explains things well and cares about students if you ask for help. Pretty funny during lecture, just make sure to take notes and study them along with the homework. She gives practice tests from the prior year which help a ton.",
            "Dr. P is a queen. Although her lectures are fast-paced, she makes it engaging and posts all the slides and recordings of lectures on Moodle for you to review again if needed. She offers up to 5% extra credit on each midterm exam and the final exam. Homework assignments are very helpful.",
            "She flies through the lectures so plan to take notes after class! If you struggle with chemistry, take the practice tests she provides before tests and go to supplemental instruction and you will do well!",
            "She gives tons of resources and is happy to help people. It's a difficult class, but as long as you watch her lectures, study, and do her old practice test, you should be fine. She does give up to 5 points of extra credit on every test based on a practice test. Prepare yourself for quick lectures and a lot of studying outside the class, though.",
            "Dr. Petrovich was great! Her tests were based on homoew",
            "Decent overall, but she does not round grades. Very frustrating",
            "Mrs. Petrovich is a good professor. It is definitely possible to get a great grade in this class but I utilized the resources she gave too late. WATCH her lectures and DO the practice tests. ALWAYS take notes. My complaint is what while her posting lecture recordings is appreciated, the organization of it is pretty bad.",
            "She is the best! She gives out many extra credits, helps with the homework, and gives valuable sources for tests and the final. Lectures are rarely boring. She is very accessible outside of class and cares for her students.",
            "Dr. P is a great professor! She is super caring and really responsive if you have questions! Her lectures very fast-paced, and I always took my notes outside of class because I couldn't keep up with her in class. The tests have extra credit, which is nice, and they are similar to the homework. I would take her again!",
            "First and foremost, she is most certainly the most difficult general chemistry teacher. That being said, she put effort into lectures and really tried her best to make it interesting. Exams weren't unreasonable and as long as you did the homework and practice they were okay. Just be prepared to study and you're fine.",
            "Dr. P is great, she's a good teacher and person. I only struggled so much because she goes SO FAST. I struggled with chem a lot before too though. BE READY TO WATCH THE LECTURES BEFOREHAND. Your success relies on being prepared BEFORE the real-life lecture. Attendance is mandatory, but you can do it from your dorm with less accuracy. Hates cheaters",
            "I think Dr. Petrovich is a solid teacher. The class is very lecture-heavy and may be fast-paced, so rewatch lectures if necessary. She provides many opportunities for students to bump up their test grades - she's generous by giving a maximum of 5 bonus points on each unit test, and a maximum of 10 points on the final. Would likely take her again."

            "Really just an awesome professor that makes some tricky concepts easily digestable and doesn't go too too hard. Provides plenty of resources to aid studying and test prep. Just don't take a laptop out during class because she will turn on you, hahaha.",
            "She lectures in an engaging way and is always open to questions. I have taken her MA 242 and 341 and would recommend her to anyone. The class is hard, but her grading criteria is clear and she is a very fair grader.",
            "Ms. Kurtz is a great lecturer! She clearly cares about all her students. Although the concepts will require some work on your end, she provides great foundations for every concept and makes them easy to understand in every lecture. The practice exams closely align to the actual exams which is very helpful. Would highly recommend her!",
            "Amazing prof that knows her stuff well. I failed the first test because I didn't prep properly but ended up acing the last three after talking with her and understanding how she teaches (go to all review sessions). I used her attendance policy to count my final grade over my failed test and learned the content well. Also funny and entertaining.",
            "10/10, she's so sweet and knows how to teach well.",
            "Kurtz is a great professor with incredible notes and class structure, however she never answered a single email I sent this semester. She is hard to reach outside of class, at least in the online section. Her tests are fair and very much like the practice ones she gives out. If you stay on top of your work you will be fine.",
            "Best math professor I have taken. She makes it VERY clear what will or won't be on tests so as long as you study what she says you will be fine. Her tests are not necessarily easy, but as long as you put time into studying you should get an A. I did not miss a single lecture because her class was so fun.",
            "She did a great job with lectures and hosted lots of help for the homework if you're struggling. Great teacher.",
            "Very nice professor? Very caring and had lots of extra practice",
            "Professor Kurtz was awesome! I loved having her as a teacher, she did a great job at connecting with her students and made me excited for calculus (a large feat). She is kind, funny, and very prepared and capable for her career.",
            "Very kind professor and genuinely cares for student's wellbeing. Lots of course material so take advantage of her many study resources on her website, but tests are fair. Lectures move fast, so always pay attention. Always go to class too. Accessible outside of class.",
            "Kurtz's classes are reserved for a reason! Even though she is a great professor, the class goes by so far and I'd only recommend if you are really good at math. There is lots of assistance offered if you aren't but its challenging",
            "Good teacher overall, just goes very quickly. The tests are very difficult and a very heavy portion of your grade.",
            "don't even need to read reviews just take her. best ever, course covers a wide range of topics but she makes it as easy as possible for us. extra credit for hw and you get unlimited attempts on most medium to hard hw q's. throws candy at you for answers :p super sweet and caring and great teaching style, fav professor of all time",
            "Great professor. She may be the best professor in the department. If you can take her then take her. If you pay attention you will be fine.",
            "Hands down the best math professor at NCSU. Her teaching is an artform. DiffEq is a hard class, but she makes it very easy. Test are fair, as the practice tests are truly reflective of test material. If you take DiffEq with her, you are guaranteed a B- at the minimum as long as you put forth the required effort. She's truly the best of the best.",
            "I took Calc 3 with her. It is a very hard class. I hated this class with such a passion. The material was terrible and I was so confused. Kurtz was an amazing professor. She had plenty of resources and is the only reason why I passed this class.",
            "Take her class",
            "The sweetest and most helpful professor at State",
            "love her, she's the best at teaching calc and I'd recommend her for any possible class. grade's mostly tests, a final and hw but she has these cute lil extra credit opps so it's not too bad. lectures are great and frankly entertaining, she has a v fun vibe and appealing sense of humor that I love. she's always open to questions, no matter how silly"

            "While I decided to grade replace this class because I would not pass it, none of it was on Mrs.Dempster. I do not recommend taking this class in the 5 days a week. Mrs.Dempster was amazing and was very supportive of me when I decided to grade exclude halfway through the semester. She greatly cares about student mental health!",
            "Great professor. Learned some of us by name which made the class feel much more personal. Very accessible outside of class, responds to emails quickly, holds office hours often. Gives extra credit as well as partial credit for tests",
            "Ms. D was the best math teacher i have ever had. She made math fun to learn, made it a point to learn some of us by name which made it feel like a much more personal class. Tests were exactly like the practice tests she posts. She gives extra credit and martial credit on tests so the tests are not very hard.",
            "Such an amazing professor! Dr. Dempster is a truly kind person who cares about her student's success. She will work with you and always encourage you in class and in office hours. Always gives time to ask questions. I thought the class was pretty easy but it was definitely due in part to how great Dempster is.",
            "Professor Dempster is amazing! She truly is a caring and understanding professor. Professor Dempster gave us lots of extra credit opportunities and explained material very well. The homework and class notes were easy to follow. However, incoming MA 111 students will need great study habits because you mostly have to rely on tests to pass.",
            "Dempster was a great professor and definitely the best for MA141. My only issues with her were that she teaches material very fast and that the tests and the exam make up 80% of your grade. But she is really kind and understanding to her students. Overall, she is great and there are a lot of advantages to taking her class.",
            "I love professor dempster so much, she goes a little fast in lecture but if you ask for help during the office hours she will work out your problem with you to make sure you understand. She picks amazing TA's and gives partial credit as she understands you are learning the material. I am not good at calculus but I still enjoyed the class.",
            "Professor Dempster was an amazing teacher. She explained things really well so you could understand the concept behind the math you were doing. And she cared about her students and would even bring in treats from time to time. She was also easily accessible through email and would post help with homework problems.",
            "She was so nice and caring. I really loved having her. Her lectures made sense and she was easy to email for questions. WebAssign was a huge thing but she understood and will help with any questions if you ask. I would absolutely recommend taking her if you can!",
            "Professor Dempster is one of my favorite teachers so far I've had at NC State. I have struggled before in Pre-Calc in high school, but Professor Dempster always gave opportunities for questions and would help with some homework questions after class if needed. Even in a hybrid class and learning modules online, I learned so much.",
            "Ms. Dempster is the best professor that anyone could ask for. She posts the class notes that are extremely organized and easy to follow. She is also very funny and thoughtful. Her tests are a large part of the course grade but she makes them fair and offers extra credit majority of the time. I personally didn't like the TA but she made up for it.",
            "Ms. Dempster is amazing!! I'm a sophomore now but I had her in the fall of my freshman year and this class was a breeze. She is very understanding and teaches in a way that is easy to comprehend and prepares you well for tests. She is very good about curving exams/giving extra credit if the whole class does poorly.",
            "Dempster was amazing. She was very clear in her lectures and always worked out a problem. She made sure that everybody understood and if they didn't she will go to that extra length in making sure you understand.",
            "Mrs. D is amazing! Her lectures are very clear and understandable. She posts many resources to go over and study before tests, even goes over tough homework problems in class. I took her last semester in 11. She is an overall great person and professor.",
            "This class is difficult and has barely any grades. You will have to rely on tests to past the class and the tests are very short with 6-7 questions and none being multiple choice. There is a lot of homework, sometimes having around 50 questions of homework due in one night and on top of that, the homework is harder than the test questions.",
            "DO NOT take this class if MA131 is what you need. Ms Dempster was awesome, but the content is so challenging and the TA is the worst explainer ever. Lots of homework grades and a couple extra credit opportunities, but it doesn't make up for how difficult this class is if you are not an engineer/math brained person. Save yourself the headache.",
            "She talks very fast and quietly. It's hard to know when she says something important because she doesn't emphasize anything. Tests were 60% of my grade but partial credit for questions were super lenient. Lots of homework but keep on top of it and it's not too bad. Just make sure to sit in the front and do and understand the homework.",
            "I don't understand how professor Dempster can receive a score lower than a 5. This was one of the best professors I've had for math and her course relieved so much of the anxiety that I had prior to taking calculus. The material is hard but as long as you try on the exams and HW, you will be fine. She gives credit if you're on the right track!",
            "I do not think I will get a teacher better than her. She was always helpful in and out of class. I emailed her a couple times about webassign errors and she instantly gave me extra tries no questions asked. She even posts her office hour question solutions with work provided to help students struggling on the same problems.",
            "Dr. Dempster is an amazing professor. She teaches the material effectively and cares about her students. Her tests are super fair, and the questions are less difficult than the ones provided in Webassign. She tests students based on their understanding of topics rather than being able to complete the most difficult problems. Would 100% recommend :)"

            "Some of these ratings and reasonings behind them are absolutely ridiculous. I think I saw one person say they had to read the textbook to pass the class, which is utterly the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. If you're not lazy and committed to actually learning the material, you'll be fine. Go to office hours.",
            "He's a fine teacher, pay attention to what he says and you will learn. His exams are brutal however, he likes to say some topics won't be on the exam and then have 30% of the exam consist of those topics. He also includes questions that cover something he hasn't taught in class yet. Get ahead if possible and study hard or you won't have a chance.",
            "It was a pleasure to take BIO 183 with Dr. Jacquet. He is an excellent professor and is extremely passionate about the course and his students performing well. He has a remarkable ability to explain biology in a way that makes it engaging, and his passion for the subject is infectious. Overall, Dr. Jacquet is an amazing person and professor! 5/5",
            "Jacquet was all over the place. He had slides for class but rarely went through them. Instead, he opened the class up to questions and went on separate tangents. There were no study guides or practice, just the textbook/slides. He ended up curving at the end so things worked out, but I feel like I didn't learn anything.",
            "Professor jumps around slideshows and you MUST pay attention to what he says during lectures or tests will be more difficult than they already are. The wording and format of exams are very tough, making you think you selected the correct answers but in the end that was not the case.The final was not cumulative which was nice.",
            "Read the textbook, the lectures are almost useless since he goes on tangents about random things. The only thing that got me through this class was reading the textbook as his texts were fairly difficult. He ended up curving the grades at the end so everything worked out.",
            "Take anyone else for BIO 183 if you can. His exams are nearly impossible and he is a terrible lecturer. He overcomplicates every topic and the powerpoints are not helpful. There was a curve at the end of the class and the lab is pretty easy so getting a decent grade is possible but you'll be stressed the whole semester over it.",
            "The lecture is interesting bc he loves talking abt his experience that relates to class materials.exams are insanely hard. it's a multiple multiple question test which means there could be only one or multiple correct answers for a question. write everything he says in class since it is possibly on the test.",
            "Very difficult class, however, Dr. Jacquet was very kind, understanding, and willing to work with you. Take advantage of office hours and you'll succeed.",
            "Dr. Jacquet is one of the best professors I've had. Ive taken numerous challenging upper level biology courses, and he is by FAR the best professor I have had. Dr. Jacquet genuinely cares about students and their success. GO TO OFFICE HOURS!!",
            "Class is mandatory, but he spends most of class ranting about material that will not be on exams. In order to get a decent grade on exams, you must attend office hours, otherwise there aren't many resources to study. And good luck sending him an email, he will answer days later with a sarcastic and unhelpful \"response\".",
            "Horrible professor. Blames the students for \"not studying enough\", when only 3 people got an A out of the entire class on the first exam.",
            "I'd give him a zero if I could. He's a nightmare: passive-aggressive, rude, and clueless about teaching. Thinks attending class and studying slides equals exam prep (it doesn't), wastes class time on rants, and demands excessive office hours attendance. And his advice: double your study time (16 hours instead of 8)....for a 200-level course.",
            "I took Beniot for BIO183, and at the end of that class, I though he was cool. This man is the mortal enemy of an anatomy student though. In BIO183, what was on the lecture slides was tested. In BIO240, you have to go to office hours frequently to pass the class and the lecture slides are useless. DONT DO IT.",
            "Dr. Benoit is the definition of I can be your angle or your devil. He is funny and energized and knows his stuff, but can be patronizing, needlessly stubborn and difficult. He is a big proponent of students going beyond the curriculum to get a good grade, but some of us have jobs and it makes the playing field less even.",
            "Dr. Jacquet makes it clear from the start of the semester that coming to his office hours and asking quality questions are key to being successful in his class and this is the truth. His exams make up the majority of the overall grade and they are decently challenging but if you study you will do fine. Curves exams a lot. Very funny & enjoyable.",

I thought he was nice but he was really being rude and disrespectful to students that are really trying. 50 minutes of class time and we go through 2 slides.",

            "He was a very non-confrontational person; didn't feel very approachable. One of those professors whose class you just go through and get out. One thing I will say is, he sticks to what he teaches (no surprises) and the practice tests he gives were very similar to the exams.",
            "Best professor for CH101 hands down. Barely any homework, his practice tests are VERY similar to the actual tests, and he does an amazing job at explaining concepts. If you are taking CH101 as a freshmen, choose this man.",
            "Pretty good professor! Didn't take attendance, but it was pretty much crucial that you showed up to each class and kept up with the content. Recitation is mostly required, with allowance for ~2 absences. 5 quizzes over the sem, and weekly problem sets. Loved that he didn't use WebAssign!",
            "Professor Maggard is a great professor for CH 101. There is very minimal homework, which is about one sheet in recitation a week. There are also about five quizzes in recitation, where it goes over the homework for that week and the lowest one is dropped. The class was easy if you attend lectures.",
            "This course wasn't very difficult and Professor Maggard is good at explaining the different concepts, but wasn't very attentive to student needs. We had class during the hurricane, online lectures during mental health day, and an exam right after Thanksgiving break. Cancelled class the night before then rescheduled it to day before break.",

He holds review sessions but they were never much help. Your grade is based upon 4 exams, the final, and recitation which has 5 semi-pop quizzes. Overall not a terrible professor but also not the best.",

Tests are similar to practice tests given and are multiple choice, but all tests include \"None of these\" as an answer choice for most the problems. His HW is light, but recommends webassign as a supplement to his class.",

As long as you show up for the lectures and put in the work to understand the content you will do fine. Although your grade is primarily made up of test scores, he provides practice exams which clearly show what will be on the tests. I would take this class again!",
            "Not a terrible teacher, but the tests were way too hard in my opinion and often had material we had never elaborated on. Don't trust his \"test reviews,\" there will still be questions on the test you will be stumped with. Take notes on EVERYTHING because he never posts his notes to Moodle, and make sure you read the textbook.",
            "Dr.Maggard was a decent professor. His tests were extremely difficult compared to other professor's like Varner's. He does curve when the average is below a 73(he curved nearly every exam heavily because his exams were hard). I wouldn't take again because it was extremely stressful and difficult. Questions on exams are ones you have never heard of.",
            "Dr. Maggard was very knowledgeable about the course content and receptive to questions. The textbook was free and provided on the course website. Test questions were similar to practice problems from the textbook. There was no WebAssign homework, only a weekly problem set to be turned in and graded for completion in recitation.",

Although, chemistry is generally a tough course he tried his best to keep it fun with in class experiments as well as providing many opportunities to ask questions. Genuinely a very good professor.",
            "Dr. Maggard is a very good lecturer, but the class is graded based on a combination of your recitation grade and 4 test grades. If you miss a lecture you have to ask someone for the notes or read the online textbook to fill yourself in. Overall, I learned a lot from him.",

Maggard does a great job at explaining concepts and provides students with study groups, practice problems, and provides practice tests with answers and explanations before midterms."

It wasn't for me, but not too bad.",

I waited till the end of my time at NCSU to leave a review and see if by the end of school she would remain the worst professor I ever had. Welp, she did. Chemistry is difficult material but she certainly didn't make it any easier. If it weren't for the curve I would have gotten an F.",

She writes ok notes I suppose, but with how difficult the content is they often aren't enough and she is a poor lecturer.

            "I passed chem with an A in high school but taking CH 101 with her had me guessing on every test (including the final). The only thing that kept me from failing was the pre/in class checks and the extra credit. If you miss a lecture, good luck. You'll be behind and attendance is graded.... She's bad with technology and talks in circles.",

Not the worst prof",

You will have to learn all of this stuff on your own before each exam.",

She jumps from things that you often need more clarification for. You will have to teach yourself everything. Extra credit is so plentiful because her class average is so low. You'll have better luck teaching yourself.",

The tests were not the same for every student, questions were randomized, so some people had many multiple choice questions while others had to fill in the blank, and topics on test weren't even",

She is not the absolute greatest at explaining concepts that are completely new to freshmen, but has super accessible office hours where she is more than happy to explain anything you're confused about, no matter how basic or difficult. Also, insane amount of extra credit on exams. Took class over COVID",

            "I loved Dr. Klesath. I took BIO 240 and 245 with her, and I wouldn't have changed a thing. She is a great lecturer especially if you use a tablet. I didn't have a tablet and still got an A in both anatomies, but if you have one, she is definitely the professor for you. She genuinely cares about how all her students do in her course. 100% recommend.",
            "I thought that her online class was manageable and pretty straightforward. There is a LOT to cover each week so stay on top of it. If you do that, you're golden. Her exams aren't SUPER difficult, but they can definitely take a lot out of you as each one is 3 hours long and packed with information. Lab was painful but doable. Overall I'd recommend!",
            "Took this class online during the summer, it was easy. There's a lot of materials and assignments, but all of them are open note. She also responds fast to emails.",
            "Dr. Klesath is a great professor, but this class is very difficult. If you want to do well, go to study halls and ask questions! Also, it can be hard to reach her outside of class so try to talk to her in person if you need to.",
            "I've taken both anatomy courses with Marta, and she has definitely gotten better since I first took her. The material is hard and some people found the way she taught to be helpful, but it never fully clicked with me. She adjusted her assignment expectations to be much more manageable which is nice.",
            "This class is test heavy so get ready to read because there is alot of material. She does not reply to emails ever and exams are not curved either, they are taken at Delta. she is good at what she does but she needs to be more responsive to her students.",
            "Attendance is not mandatory but Professor Klesath is not responsive to her emails. I've emailed her numerous times and no response. She tends to be all over the place but if you do the work and put in ample amount of time to study then you will do well."

I appreciated having to answer group questions periodically during lecture to keep me awake and attentive. The mini tests are pretty reasonable and the LA review sessions are SUPER helpful, definitely try to attend weekly if you can!",
            "She was easy to get ahold of outside of class when I had trouble. 6 mini quizzes, which you need an 80 on to pass. Content heavy, be sure to study a lot for her class. Review material shows up on every mini quiz. Prepare for that.",
            "there are mini tests instead of actual exams. Get above an 80 on them and your grade gets bumped up to a 100. You can also retake the test and your grade gets bumped if you score 85 or more. Very nice and accessible outside of class. Read the lecture slides and you'll be good. the textbook readings weren't that crucial to doing well on the tests.",
            "Clearly an introductory class that has somewhat of a highschool feel. Dr. Kosal is passionate about biology though and includes interesting stories, case studies, etc. in her lectures. 6 mini tests and a final instead of the normal 3 quizzes, but if you get an 80 you get full credit which was nice (unless you get a 79 haha).",
            "I wouldn't recommend Dr. Kosal. Her class was weirdly formatted, and she explained the material in a way that made it more confusing and took longer than needed. Only 3 homework assignments, 2/3 took over two hours. Attendance is mandatory with in-class group assignments and mini-tests every two weeks. I would've rather done it online.",
            "Dr. Kosal is an amazing professor and a very nice person. Attendance is not mandatory but all of the assignments are easy group work completed in class each day, so you can't miss class. \"Mini Tests\" were every other week, but this was too much for me to study after basically every lecture, I'd rather have 3-4 large exams.",
            "She's super nice and gives lots of opportunities to do well. She lets you retake tests and if you score above an 80 she rounds to a 100. There's a lot of group work in class but the questions are super easy. The only thing is that it's difficult to calculate grades in Moodle and sometimes her lectures go over time. Otherwise 10/10 reccomend!",
            "Dr. Kosal was good however her teaching style had a very high school feel to it. 181 is the bio class many freshman take so I understand. She does 6 \"mini-test\" that you just have to get an 80% on to be counted as a 100% (you can retake to). While these test are mostly easy and straightforward sometimes the questions actually make zero sense at all",
            "Dr. Kosal is such a sweet and amazing person and a passionate professor, she is a kind person who gives every opportunity for you to do well in her course. Everything is pretty straightforward when it comes to expectations- Mini Tests can sometimes be difficult but with the help of the TAs and LAs you will be fine. Take her if you can!",
            "Very sweet professor. Her lectures are sometimes a little dry but she cares a lot about everyone and tries her best to be engaging. About 7 \"Mini-tests\" which are pretty much real tests but for smaller point values (any grade above 80 becomes a 100). She has 4 learning assistants which have been very helpful in the studying process. I recommend her",
            "This class is not difficult, however there are 5 tests through the semester that are described as \"mini-tests\" but are not at all mini, they are full-length exams and have some hyper specific questions. Slides are not posted until well after class. There are 2 homework assignments that were not difficult but took some time.",
            "Dr. Kosal is nice, however, everything she explains is confusing, the mini-test questions make 0 sense, and she speeds through lectures. You need to study a lot, as she asks about the smallest details on the test. If you get a B or higher on the tests you get an automatic 100%, which made it more bearable. There are 100% better professors to take.",
            "The semester isn't over yet but I just went to see her in her office.  She is so nice and understanding.  Class is fun - always interesting.  Time goes by quickly because you are working a lot in groups.  You can retake a test and the textbook is free and online.",
            "For an intro to college course, it felt a lot like a high school class with all the groupwork. A lot of work for the amount of credits the course is worth. Interesting case study. Two textbooks for readings.",
            "Super nice.  Good to work in groups.  Learned a lot.",
            "This class has way more work than necessary. Lectures are about specific scientists/experiments, but the homework is out of the book and about your own experience. Everything in class is group work, and everyone is graded the same. Dr. Kosal is great and very helpful outside of class, but there is so much work compared to the material.",
            "Dr. Kosal is so sweet and caring! There are",
            "Mrs. Kosal was great but this class is very boring lol. Since she is the head of the LSFY department she shares a lot of opportunities during class which is nice. We had more homework than I expected for a two credit class.  There are two books we read and then have homework assignments for, four journal prompts and two main reflection papers.",
            "Kosal is amazing! No tests, but biweekly quizzes. It is easy to prepare for quizzes as long as you take decent notes and go over them. She and the TAs provide ample review opportunities to prep for these quizzes and you can always have a retest. Lectures are interesting and easy to follow",
            "Dr. Kosal made this class more work than it was meant to be. Notable stressful assignments include: 2 2000-word reflections with 1 week to work, a \"semester-long\" group project introduced halfway through the semester, and very particular ways to do citations. She is a nice person, but bad at managing assignment weight and distribution."

Extremely forgiving.",
            "Dr. Hyman only ever did online async. lectures and he did his best to make them interesting. The lectures are basically the same thing as the textbook. All the exams were multiple choice so it wasn't too bad.",
            "Dr. Hyman put this class online before the semester started so honestly it was one of the easiest classes ever. I just copied down the powerpoint notes and did the assignments using them. go to the labs. its annoying that they are required but they actually do help a lot.",
            "The lectures were a bit slow and dull but Hyman tries to make them more enjoyable with songs and funny examples. The whole class is pretty straightforward/easy including a very laid-back grade scale. Just make sure to buy the red practice/review book and work through all of the problems. Some of them will be on the exams word for word.",
            "He is really passionate about teaching, which is always amazing to see. He was always so excited in the lectures. The tests were really easy, and I didn't really study anything. Make sure to look over the practice tests, as they are really similar to the actual tests.",
            "Online class was not bad, seems would be more difficult in person. I haven't learned much but I am making good grade",
            "Hyman's grade scales are more forgiving (Ex. 100 - 95 A+, 95 - 90 A, 90 -85 A-), and if you study the problems in the Red Book he will mention you can buy from the student store before tests, you are good to go",

Luckily he has practice tests for you to do, and the tests are fairly easy (the second one was the hardest). Online quizzes are straightforward - just remember to practice before taking.",
            "Although Dr. Hyman was gone half the semester, he is a great lecturer who tried to make economics fun with stories and music. I still zoned out in class so I ended up teaching myself most of it. Lectures posted online. There was HW. GET THE PRACTICE RED BOOK! Test questions are extremely similar to problems in there or came straight from lecture.",
            "Dr Hyman was out for the second half of the semester for my class but the half that he was here was good. He makes boring material more interesting and plays funny background music to keep you entertained. There are only tests and the first is pretty easy but the second is a lot harder. Get the practice book! The textbook I got from the library.",
            "Hands down the best professor for economics. He's absolutely hilarious and explains econ concepts really well. Tests are pretty straight forward. You don't need as high of a numerical grade to get a certain letter (ex 77B-, 80B, etc)",
            "He makes his lectures fun and engaging. The 3 Tests are super easy and there is almost no homework. Everything is explained in class so the textbook is unnecessary, though the practice test booklet is useful if you arent a strong test taker.",
            "Dr. Hyman is a great professor. He played music in class and seemed to really enjoy teaching. I found his class to be easy. I never really payed attention in lecture, but I studied from the red book for the tests and that was all I needed. I never used the text book for the class, only the optional red book with practice problems.",
            "Dr. Hyman was really great at teaching economics; he comes very prepared to class and knows what he's talking about. Grades are decided by the lab grade, 2 midterms, and the final, so get all the points you can on those 4 things. If you pay attention during class, the 1st test will be a breeze--but make sure you study extra for the 2nd one.",
            "Best teacher in college so far. Music in the lectures, tells great jokes/stories, really tries to keep people awake. Thoroughly understands the material and does a solid job of making sure you do too. Even easier if you took Civics and Econ in hs. I would rate him even higher if I could. Don't buy the textbook, but do use the practice book! Helpful",
            "Dr. Hyman was quite a character. He's very passionate about Econ, and it showed in his lectures. The only downside was that the majority of the grade was exams, but if you show up and pay attention, you should do fine.",
            "He is so funny and lectures are interesting and covers everything you need to know. if you pay attention you don't even need to study for the test (literally!). His tests are easy and fair. I bet he is the best person to take Econ 205 with 10/10 I would take him again! And don't buy the testbook ( you won't ever need it)",
            "Dr. Hyman is very funny and good at engaging students with music and wild scenarios in his lectures. I eventually started to copy the slides ahead of time just so I could listen. The textbook isn't necessary but the optional workbook gives you helpful practice problems. Only grades are the 3 exams and lab (so stay on top of those assignments).",
            "The lectures are really fun and he makes them so interesting. The tests are challenging but if you buy the optional review book then its literally the test. Definitely recommend him! Only bad thing is your grade is only 3 tests are your lab grade. Never homework. Also uses the 13 point grade scale.",
            "Hyman actually makes a relatively boring subject surprisingly interesting with hilarious scenarios and dramatic timing all set to various music pieces. The class is easy enough if you just briefly look over the powerpoints too. If you're taking EC 205 he's the best professor to have."

Grades are due in 2 days and she currently only has 2 of the 10+ assignments from the semester graded so we have no idea how we are doing. Class was interesting but a ton of busy work. I really wouldn't recommend unless she makes some changes and gets on top of things.",

Just be ready to put in work to succeed.",

If you're looking for a relatively easy class with little work you should take this. \n\nBUT...\n\nShe has us do a semester long project that I felt was pretty much completely busy work. It took a really long time and I don't think I learned too much from it. She was not good at explaining her projects.",

            "I get the sense that she used to be very passionate about her subject, but that she's become more cynical over time. She'll take time to rant about political ideologies and just be unprofessional. She's also extremely disorganized with tests and curriculum to the point where the TAs have to clean up behind her. It's awkward.",

Show up to class, that all",

I liked that I got 3 attempts for the HW, highest grade taken. Each exam is based on at least 200 slides so its very important to study hard. He is not very helpful either so don't even bother asking him.",
            "go to class and do good on homework to boost your exam grade. Exams do not test your knowledge of content which sucks. Also the first exam is by far the easiest so do well on that (still hard af) exam 2 is okay if u know the conent and exam 3 is soooo hard i spent 20 hours studying and did worse than the others so just dont even try! good luck :))!",
            "Dr. Halweg is honestly not the best professor. He just reads off of powerpoints with 100+ slides, so every time an exam comes up it feels like you just have to teach the material to yourself. I would spend 4+ days before exams of almost constant studying and still got B's & C's every exam. Be prepared to WORK for your grade.",
            "Do NOT take this professor. He does not care for his students. This professor has 200+ powerpoint slides that he does not explain well. He will read off of the slides and cannot/ does not elaborate. During his office hours, he just refers you to look at the textbook or the practice questions and does not actually help you.",
            "Does not do a well job of explaining the concepts, TopHat questions are out to get you and you get a 50 if you get it wrong. He reads off the powerpoints and tests are hard.",
            "The tests were not too bad and there are practice problems and the homework problems which resembled the test. However, in terms of teaching the material Halweg was not the best. I would reccomend taking it with Dr.Jones. There is no cumulative final exam and there are weekly homework assignments.",
            "The rate my professor scared me, but he was great. He taught the material well and there were lots of extra credit opportunities. While the class had a lot of material, that's how it would be for any professor teaching the class. There's no cumulative final, just a module 5 test. HW was not overwhelming and helped to understand the material.",
            "I know Dr. Halweg has mixed reviews, but I quite liked him. He was very kind to me when I went to his office hours or emailed him, and he seemed to care about students, their well-being, and their success. The material he covers is dense and difficult, but that's just the nature of the class. Study and work hard and you can do well.",
            "Does not care about the success of his students. Will read off the lecture slides, and attendance is mandatory. When I was struggling in class and attended his office hours he told me to look at his powerpoint. The exams are conceptual and weighed heavily. If you can take this course elsewhere I suggest that you do so.",
            "At first I did NOT like him, but then I started to think he was funny in the middle of the semester. By the end, I really liked him. He is a vibe! The last lecture is really cool. Tests are hard, but if you use the guides he gives then it's fine. And I was annoyed that we had to buy the textbook because I didn't really use it.",
            "To be a junior in Human Bio and have this be my most difficult class I have EVER taken is ridiculous. The tests are random questions from 200+ powerpoint slides and are set up to be failed.Moves much too fast and has way too much material for the first level genetics class most students take. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO.",
            "He made the class entertaining and has a bunch of study materials available for tests. If you use them and look at the learning outcomes you should be good!",
            "Prof. Halweg isn't that bad, and he's actually quite nice. He's willing to answer any question and is accessible outside of class. I feel that most of the difficulty is just from the class/material itself. Since the material is so dense, you HAVE to pay attention and take good notes. Attendance is also a small part of your grade.",
            "Attendance was a grade in a class that should not have forced attendance. Study well.",
            "The worst part about this class is that the exams are up to a month behind the lecture material. We would learn something starting September 15 and the exam covering it is not until halfway through October. It is difficult to absorb new material when you are worried about studying and grasping the past material.",
            "Dr. Halweg is a very nice professor. The course moves pretty quickly after exam one so be prepared to stay on top of lectures. Attendance is mandatory.",
            "Dr. Halweg is a phenomenal professor. His class can be difficult but if you go to class, take notes, do the homework, and attend the problem sessions then it's 100% doable. Dr. Halweg is pretty funny and he's also understanding and caring when it comes to mental health which is reassuring. I definitely recommend him as a professor."

He is very enthusiastic about the lectures, often showing us interesting videos and in-class demonstrations. Be prepared for difficult tests, but as other ppl have said, memorize the test questions he gives you beforehand and you're good.",
            "Extremely funny and understanding, but lectures could get a little boring. Exams were all complied off of Moodle questions, so very easy to study for. Highly recommend.",
            "This class isn't as easy as you think it is. Requires A LOT of memorization. Lectures and textbook are barely supplementary, the question bank memorization is how you do well. Nice guy but also calls on people at random in the class just like teachers in high school. You also need to have some knowledge of physics or chem as well.",
            "This man is so funny. He's super engaging and clearly cares about what he's teaching. He was always really nice, respectful, and full of dad jokes. 100% would recommend. Class starts out easy and gets harder, but overall, interesting material and cool professor.",
            "Professor Fortner makes his lectures extremely interesting and engaging. He's extremely funny and approachable. He loves when you ask questions. If you're not a STEM person, then you might struggle a bit. It was a bit difficult due to the chemistry and math aspects, but if you actually pay attention and study, you'll be fine.",
            "Dr. Fortner was super funny and I enjoyed going to his classes. He expected everyone to know at least a bit of physics or calc, which nobody did. The tests were easy as he would post the answer keys and you would just have to memorize. Overall, I thought he was a great professor and would recommend him.",
            "This class was easy if you are good at memorizing. He is very caring and funny and an amazing person however his lectures can be kinda dense. He gives you all the questions and answers to the test before the test but chooses like 70 out of 200 questions to put on the test so if you can memorize you're honestly set.",
            "He is a super funny and engaging professor, however if you cannot memorize things easily do not take this class. Majority of your grade comes from four exams, so it's hard if you are not a good test taker.",
            "Professor Fortner is the best at NC State without a doubt. He is phenomenal, super funny, and gives you exactly what you need to do well in the course. All of the test questions come from the practice quizzes on Moodle. Memorize them and you are guaranteed a 100. If you ever get the opportunity to take a course with him, DO IT! You won't regret it.",
            "Great man, funny dude",
            "He is a very funny and nice professor. Make sure to read the textbook and do the homeworks. Make use of the practice questions on Moodle as well. I really enjoyed his class, despite me not being able to pay attention, but that is only because of my attention span, not him.",
            "Awesome astronomy professor. Funny, engages the class, and has a good time. The tests are really easy to study for if you can memorize Moodle questions, cuz theyre straight off of there. HW isn't bad either; maybe an hour of reading + webassign questions twice a week. There's group assignments but its ~10 mins during each class, mostly extra credit",
            "Professor Fortner is a very good teacher and you can tell he is very into teaching his lectures. He will throw in the occasional corny joke. Tests are challenging but he gives you the exact answers that will be on the test to study so I found just constantly doing those was the best study method. Overall a great class.",
            "Just a phenomenal professor, clearly extremely passionate and knowledgeable about astronomy. Funny at times too. Class is a bit more challenging than your average course but the material is very interesting so it makes up for it. \n\nHW consists of ~20 questions each week on webassign, not too bad. Tests are challenging but manageable.",
            "Don't take this class if you're not good at science. It is not taught like a 100 level course. Professor Fortner is accommodating and lets you watch the lectures online if you'd like. However, the lectures, at least for someone who doesn't understand science as easily, were extremely difficult to absorb.",
            "If you have the time to study, this class is an easy A. Your entire grade is based on 4 exams and he provides moodle study guide quizzes for everyone. In theory, if you memorize all the questions/ answers on moodle, you will get an easy A. I cannot stress this enough, do the study questions until you physically can't take it anymore.",
            "This class is exam heavy. You must study if you want to do well. DO THE PRACTICE QUESTIONS!!! The exams are carbon copies of these. Otherwise, Dr. Fortner gives very good lectures and is also funny at times and compassionate. I recommend if you need a geoscience GEP.",
            "Professor Fortner is extremely knowledgeable in everything he teaches. His lectures were extremely thought-provoking, and he is extremely compassionate and kind. This class is not easy though, you definitely have to study. He gives you the materials you need to be successful in his class, it is just up to you to use them!",
            "Love Professor Fortner. The class itself is much harder than I was expecting. Definitely don't think you will just be looking at stars everyday. If you do the practice questions over and over though you will be ok. The lectures themselves were confusing and difficult to understand. Overall however, I would highly recommend him as a professor.",
            "Great professor, simple and to the point. He seems to be very overqualified and is just teaching for fun. Extremely knowledgable on the subject. Homework is due before each class and he puts out the test question bank out to study."

            "A majority of the class is just regular assignments that build up to your 3 major essays, basically forcing you to do your work and destroying any form of procrastination. Her student examples are VERY helpful and she offers a lot of extra credit. BUT if there is a very tiny detail in your essay, she WILL find it so work hard and you'll be fine.",
            "Professor Lloyd does receive a lot of negative reviews but don't let it scare you away. She goes over her expectations multiples times and even if they do seem extreme you need to follow them to get a good grade. She also gave us Fridays off, which was nice.",
            "Prof. Lloyd is one of the toughest graders I have ever had. The formatting requirements for her papers are extremely constrictive. It feels like you cant take any creative freedom in your papers you will be marked off. she did offer plenty of opportunities for paper reviews and milestones to help with pacing and plenty of extra credit",
            "This lady is awful. Flat out. I cannot exaggerate that enough. She gives a clear layout for every paper she assigns and demands that you stick to it religiously. Then, she marks you off for following that layout. Make sure your citations are perfect. This is not treated like an ENG101 class.",
            "Her grading consists of three papers, the final, and participation, but do not let that scare you! Almost every assignment is work for the papers, and she has many extra credit opportunities most weeks. She is not the type of professor to assign \"busy work\" and gives great feedback! She also gives second chances on some papers, which help a lot.",
            "Honestly, she is caring if you tell her whats up and forgiving. She gives a lot of extra credit opportunities but also grades tough (and rightfully so). She knows her stuff. Paper instructions were a little hard to follow but she offers any help! Be prepared for peer reviews and remember, any english class is never what it was in high school.",
            "She treats this like we're english majors in our senior year. It's not that deep. She really cares about writing and that's good for her. But it's freshman english. I'm a straight A student and I'll pass this class with barely a B if I'm lucky. Not an easy A or an easy B. Do not take english with her unless you want your papers torn up.",
            "Mrs. Lloyd is a fair but tough grader. She consistently keeps everyone on track with how she formats her class but she does grade the papers somewhat harshly. I would suggest taking her class several times a week for 45 min because they do tend to get a little boring.",
            "She helps guide you through all of the papers you have to write, although she definitely is a bit of a harsh grader. Attendance is mandatory and her classes are pretty much all her talking. Its a fine class, I did think it would be easier considering it is Eng 101.",
            "Wanda likes to hear herself talk. This was made painfully clear during the countless worthless lectures we sat through. She asked us to critique her one time but she didn't take that well. If you mess something up on a paper and ask for feedback, prepare to brave the maze of ambiguous critique and a standoffish attitude. Glad that's over.",
            "Coming into ENG 101, I expected the class to be somewhat easy and do-able. With Prof. Lloyd, that was not the case. Super strict on papers, got a D- on all of my papers. She did not give good feedback either. I suggest taking this class in person versus online with Professor Lloyd. From now on, I will always check rate my professor first.",
            "While the assignments are graded pretty harshly, there are countless opportunities for extra credit to bring your grade up. Her class was definitely a lot of work but it really is helpful in bettering your writing. If you are good at English and willing to put a lot of time into her class, then go for it.",
            "She is a tough grader like many have said but she is also very fair in her grading. The class is very well structured and she is very open to helping students outside of class. She is very available and if you go she will help you improve your essay. She also offers second chances on the essays so you can use her feedback to improve your grade.",

Classes were mandatory, but were mostly filled with dead air, just waiting for questions to be asked. She gave unhelpful feedback on my papers, like: \"This is not what is expected of a college writer.\" Ok....",

I managed to get by in the class, only after I redid two papers she gave me an F on because of faulty citing. If you take this class, be prepared for the nitpicking of your lifetime!",
            "Good professor but pretty harsh grader. Most reviews here make it seem worse that it is. I read these at the beginning of this semester and was worried about this class but it wasn't bad at all. Show up to class and get extra help from her, she takes that into consideration when grading. Overall decent first year ENG if you can handle the workload.",

Lots of homework and T/F quizzes and they are not worth much of your grade, so do them to understand not for correctness. Tests are the exact format as homework. Dr. Danielsen is always helpful.",
            "Bart is a very good guy. Although the course is set up to be mainly test-heavy, they are not very hard as long as you do the HW and the review. He does a very good job of being entertaining in what most people find a boring class.",

I liked both the content and going to lectures because he is very passionate about what he does. Just do the homework and watch the lectures, and you don't really need to read the textbook because he allows you to take it with you at Delta.",

The exams definitely have stuff that we haven't even learned yet, which sucks bc this is an intro to finance class. You have to go to DELTA to take exams, so oof. GL ):",

HW is for the most part similar to the test and textbooks with sticky notes as well as a page of notes are allowed for all tests. If you show up to class, do all the homework assignments, and briefly review (~2 hrs.) the homework and take notes for the test you will do well in this class",

Tests count for 89% of the entire grade, so focus your time on studying for those and filling out the cheatsheets. Also, buying the textbook is a must as he allows you to use it on the tests.",
            "This is a great class if you do choose to pursue finance in the future. A lot of it is self taught because you need to grasp the concepts yourself to do well in the class. The exams are worth 89% of final grade so focus a lot of your time studying for that, tests are just like the homework and textbook can be used on exams. Overall, great class.",
            "Professor Danielsen is a nice man with good intentions. If you are struggling on exams or homework (which are identical), he will give you personalized advice to succeed/try if you go talk to him one on one. Lectures are extremely dry but hint videos on the homework help. Write down how to do all the problems on your notes sheet and you'll do well",
            "Dr. Danielsen's lectures are often disconnected from the class material or tend to go down rabbit trails. However, he is very very knowledgeable about finance and so worth taking -- not sure if he'll be teaching this class next year or not, but I'd recommend him.",
            "His class is tough, but Professor Danielsen gives you EVERY resource he can to assist you and provide support for the material and has good lectures if you pay attention. If you do not put work into this class, you will fail all of the exams and the class. Also, the exams were exactly like the homework, we never had something we hadn't learned.",

            "nice guy & accommodating. Curved the grade like crazy to be fair. The tests were very hard imo & required a lot of studying, a good amount of math-related problems, but if you study the homework and the textbook material well before the exam you will be good.

Helped my understanding",

She is very nice and accepts late work, the only thing is she doesn't grade big assignments quickly.",

FLS331 has about 1hr of homework for every class (3x/week) and 3 different group projects that are 50min presentations, and 6 zooms outside of class that are an hour each that you need to schedule yourself. In my opinion it's way too much for a 3 credit hour class.",

Tests were simple if you pay attention to lectures and read the textbook (EASY textbook). Main flaw was how long it took her to grade assignments. She is nice and understanding.",

            "She was a decent professor but it didnt make up for the complete lack of grading. Of the 6 tests/ projects I got back a grade for one test for the whole semester. She submitted a grade past due for the grade book but still no individual project or test feedback. So disappointing to not have any feedback on how you did in a class."

Took for fun, ended up failing. \nChanged Final Exam date so I couldn't take at my scheduled test date! \nDidn't care about computer issue, gave me a 0 on quiz. 3 tests, 3 quizzes.",
            "I was hesitant going into this class due to the other reviews but honestly Heinen was a great professor, explained the material very well and lectures and reading quizzes aligned perfectly with the exams. Not that hard and not that much reading people writing these reviews have to be extremely lazy or something idk this class was totally fine.",
            "Tries to make classes fun and interesting and encourages people to ask questions. Had some health complications during class and he was completely understanding and helped me get back on track. It's a difficult class, but he does a good job of making it as straight forward as possible.",
            "Never made you feel bad for not understanding something and clearly cared about everyone in class. I've taken latin several times before, and this was the most fun I've ever had in class; he's approachable and explains things well, and always encourages people to ask questions. Excited to take his class again next semester!",
            "Don't take this class if you don't have to. He teaches way too much specific material that it is hard to know what to study even with study guides. Exams are moved into DELTA & we get one sheet of notes which helps very little. The class was disorganized & I never felt that he actually wants us to do well in the class. Avoid this class if you can.",
            "I feel as though Dustin did the absolute bare minimum with this class. He clearly used some old lectures he had and then has other graders do everything. So my question is, What does he do? Ignores emails and shows little no interests in his students.",
            "Impossible exam because there is an insane amount of reading in a small time frame.",
            "Don't take the class unless it is a required course. While the professor is passionate about the subject, in lectures he just assumes you know things. It is an intro level class but there was so much he assumed we already know. Terribly hard exams where you are tested for memorization skills and not the actual concepts or themes of myth.",
            "Anything but a easy class. Memorization based>teaching.  Learning is solely made up of reading very confusing passages and watching long lectures. He gives 4- 25 minutes quizzes each week that are open note but very hard to complete in the time frame. The two exams are closed book/note. Only class that has given me anxiety.",
            "IMMENSE amount of weekly reading. Weekly quizzes that are timed with written and multiple choice questions. I was looking forward to completing the course but due to the overwhelming and lack of clarity on what material to focus on for exams/quizzes I dropped it. Listen to the other reviews! Take this course only if it is a REQUIREMENT!",
            "I have taken two classes with Dr. Heinen. Honestly, I think he is probably one of the best professors I have had at NC State University. However, that does not mean his class is for the faint of heart. You have to participate, you have to study, and do the work for a good grade. He isn't a professor that will allow you to float through his class.",
            "He gives out a decent amount of homework and there are quizzes every week. This is a class where if you don't participate you won't pass. If you're not willing to put in work, don't take this. If you're down to work hard and give effort into this class, then go right ahead. He wants you to succeed, but only if you give him something to work with.",
            "Graded on quizzes and a few exams. He's really nice and loves to teach and help you! He wants you to do well in his class!",
            "This is LAT 201 but slightly faster paced with more translation homework, presentations, and a paper. If you enjoy Latin I would recommend this class, but if you don't really care and just want to get the minor I would pass. Dr. Heinen makes class enjoyable and has a lot of grace for students regarding translations. I would take it again.",
            "This class is a lot of translations. This is meat of Latin and the class is built on 101 and 102. How a student does in those classes is a good predictor of how they will do in this class. How good a student does on translation predicts how they will do on tests. Everything that is tested on is gone over in class.",
            "Difficult class that takes a lot of time. It is definitely a step up from 101! The class is difficult but doable. If you spend a lot of time working through the material then you can get an A, but do not expect an easy class. The teacher is understanding and tries to give students the benefit of the doubt in grading.",
            "Dr. Heinen is a fun professor that invests a lot into the program. He genuinely cares about students and if you are struggling he is open to meeting outside of class. The class is very memorization heavy, so if you are not able to memorize a lot vocabulary and spend time outside of class reviewing the material then do not take this class.",
            "The negative reviews fail to keep in mind latin is a very difficult subject. Heinen does a great job of explaining concepts but there's only so much he can do to make you memorize the material, you have to do that on your own outside of class which can be extremely difficult. This guy is the only reason I get up to go to class in the morning.",
            "This class is very much on your own the material is very dense, a lot of readings some would say too much, there are 4 quizzes and 2 exams and a discussion post - the quizzes are not easy by any means even if you do study same with exams, however the discussion post is relatively easy, I just dont recommend this class to anyone",
            "You will fail this class it is not an easy enough class for just a GEP credit. There's so much reading that you will not be able to keep up with for 4 quizzes and 2 exams that determine your entire grade. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS IT'S FOR SOME REASON RELATED TO YOUR MAJOR."

Essay questions and quizzes are very comprehensive- quizlets for quizzes, but you really need to know sources and patterns for essays. Definitely my hardest class of the semester.",
            "Dr. Parker is very apparently passionate about the material, and learning this from a man who did the work in the field is great. Lectures are informative, though time consuming. The 5-week course is a tad rough, time wise. Exams are mostly essay based, and the exams are a breeze as long as you take an actual interest in the material.",
            "The usual I would expect from a history course. His lectures are easy enough to follow. I do not recommend getting the textbooks as the Parker text just has what's on the slides and some reading - you can find this in the library or online. It was not too hard or much of a difficult commitment. I recommend the course.",
            "By far my favorite professor of the semester. Dr. Parker's HI207 was lecture heavy yet engaging as Dr. Parker is knowledgeable of the subject and a true expert in the field. He always managed to interject some humor into his lectures as well. I would highly recommend his course for those interested in Greek and Roman history.",
            "Professor Parker is truly inspirational. Not only did he write the companion textbook himself, but the pictures on the book are ones he took from an actual dig site he and his NCSU team excavated back in 1990s. He is passionate about the material, he is funny, and engaging. Watch the lectures, take notes, do the study guide and you'll do great!",
            "I took this class online and it was videos of his lectures, 3 papers, 2 midterms, and the final just like everyone else. Exams were taken at the Delta center on Centennial which was kind of annoying but I didn't mind. Papers were fine but exams were stressful bc they're 30% MC and 70% essay. Study the terms early on and practice the essays",
            "Little communication throughout the semester but extremely interesting lectures. TAKE NOTES. Get the textbook and take notes from that first and then listen to lectures. Make connections with the terms on the study guide. Final exam is cumulative but he does recycle SOME old test questions. Quizlets out there to help, seriously use them. 3 papers.",
            "Grades consist of two midterms, 3 papers, and a cumulative final that is weighted more towards the last unit. LOTS of material covered but as long as you actually put in the work to study and make connections you'll do fine. Midterms consist of 10 to 11 multiple choice and then an essay (gives you 3 prompts and you pick one). Repeat note taking!",
            "If you did not read prior to his class you will feel stupid when he calls on you. Participation is a driving factor of the class. However, it was a very enjoyable class and I loved the discussions.",
            "If you are not a history buff, do not take this class for your history GEP. The exams are essay- style, where you have to read every single primary source & know every person in each unit. Dr. Parker is a very passionate person about what he is talking about & it shows, but lectures can be slow and dry. Prob one of the hardest histories I've taken.",
            "never take the online class. The professor never once contacted me or sent me an email or graded anything i did. he basically gave the entire class to the TA, who graded the papers insanely hard. do not take the online class if it not your major. this was supposed to be an easy GEP for me and it was the hardest classes of my semester.",
            "You don't need to read the textbook for this class because that is what is powerpoint lectures are based on. There are few grades in the class (3 quizzes, 2 midterms, and a final paper), and most of the class is essay based. Overall, Dr. Parker makes it interesting and it is not too much work if you don't procrastinate.",
            "Its an easy class and straightforward. Read through the material and try to make connections/comparisons between different cultures as you go.",
            "Dr. Parker is a very nice man and a knowledgable professor. He loves to teach, and his knowledge is amazing! However, the class was VERY VERY hard when it came to the tests and quizzes. You are screwed if you can't remember small details well. I would only reccomend this course to people that absorb and remember history easily- otherwise, BEWARE!",
            "Taking Mr. Parker's online class was the worst mistake!! Lectures were extremely boring and the exams reviews were BROAD while the actual exams had only 10 questions and 1 essay. Response papers were graded harshly by the TA. I would not recommend this class to anyone who is not a history buff.",

Dr. Parker is incredibly good at giving interesting lectures and really knows the topics inside out, as he has dedicated his life's work to the topics covered in this class. Made me genuinely interested in a history class, a first for me.",
            "Dr. Parker is an amazing history professor. He is extremely devoted to what he is teaching and clearly very knowledgable on topics he presents. To succeed in this class, attendance and note taking is mandatory. If you pay attention in lectures, doing well in his class is very doable and you will come out of the class having learned so much!",
            "This class is hard if you hate history. The textbook is literally just an outline of notes that he gives you in class. He talks pretty fast, so notes are hard to get down quickly. The discussion section and grading is done by the TA's.. Tests are essays, there's a few quizzes, and participation is graded.",
            "Professor Parker brings humor and interesting stories to history. He has an endearing way of talking that makes it easy to listen, but I think the online class may have diminished the connection that a student could have with him.",
            "If you don't like essay tests, he is not the professor for you. That being said, Dr. Parker is a real gem. He genuinely cares about his students and will jump for joy if you visit him in his office hours. He is my #1 ally on campus and has become a mentor to me. Very knowledgeable and passionate about course material. Visit his archaeology lab!"

This class is very test heavy and home work heavy but if you stay on top of the work you will be fine.",
            "I loved Profe McConnell!!! I was having a rough semester with a lot of things going on, but he spaced out assignments and was flexible with what we needed as a class. He is very caring and charismatic (which helps in the morning), and I would love to take another class with him!!!!",
            "Super awesome class! Main focus is on being able to produce language, so for many assignments as long as you're getting your idea across you're doing great. Starts each class off with a short speaking exercise that usually relates to bettering mental health in some way or another, and the group project is really fun. Really cares about students :D",
            "Highly recommend taking his class.  Super friendly and outgoing, accessible outside of class, and pretty accommodating.  Participation in class discussions matters a lot.  Lots of homework in the beginning but decreases w/ none for the last month of class.  His activities are fun, he brings snacks, and he'll change the agenda if better for students",

            "One of the best spanish professors I've ever had. He's hilarious and the care he has for students really shows. I had him at 8:30 in the morning which was hell, but I'd recommend him to anyone regardless of how early his class is. Easy easy class if you just show up, participate, and put a little effort in. You'll 100% make an easy A.\nTAKE HIM!!!!",
            "Overall , a dislikable person for a dislikable class. You can feel the attitude through emails, TA's grade everything which sucks because they have something to prove. Hard class, lots of assignments and be prepared to teach yourself because \"lectures\" are like two minutes.",
            "Do not expect this class to be an easy A. You will receive lots of homework, on top of assignments and quizzes. The midterm and final are extremely hard so be prepared to study even harder. If at all possible, I would avoid his class if you arent into teaching yourself.",
            "I see a lot of bad reviews on her for McConnell, I understand where some people would be upset because spanish is a hard subject to learn, but it's not entirely the professors fault. At the end of the day Professor McConnell taught the course well. His TA's worked more with us individually while McConnell taught. For FLS 101 I recommend him.",
            "Not responsive to students. Basically handed class off to TAs who weren't much better at responding either. You'll have to teach yourself and use MindTap to do that. He doesn't teach or cover material. Test average was 62% and he barely offered resources to improve and didn't curve. Nice guy but not a good teacher. Take someone else.",
            "This class was incredibly frustrating. It is completely asynchronous, so be ready to teach yourself all material. There are also NO test curves or extra credit. Our class average for the first test was 62%, but still, no curve. He is a very passive teacher and will let his TAs do everything, so don't bother reaching out for help.",
            "If youre not the best at Spanish, I dont recommend taking this. You will teach yourself 99% of the material. The workload isnt bad, takes me about 1-2 hours to complete homework for the week. The first test was hard, even though the material itself isnt too difficult. Im just hoping to end with a B.",
            "Taking Prof. McConnell's class was a joke at best. His lectures were useless and you basically end up teaching yourself the material through mindtap and the online textbook which I could also write a whole paragraph about. However I will say, the class got better when the lecture switched to half video lectures, half zoom call. TA's did most work.",
            "This class is the most useless class I have ever taken. You will get a fourth grade understanding of \"technology in the spanish world\" which is just you reading basic articles about dumb technology. The entire class could be taught as a single chapter of another course. Then he will give you a hard test which will basically decide your grade.",
            "If you are the person seeking 201 credit DO NOT take this class. Unless you can fluently speak and write and read in Spanish you will make a D or C in this class. Tests are 60% of the class and the class average is usually 75-80. This is including the Spanish majors/minors taking the course as an elective. Do not take. DO NOT TAKE.",
            "This class is taught so bad. The technology aspect is literally 4th grade vague explanations of technology in English of which is completely useless. He doesn't teach or grade anything and is somehow still extremely uptight and annoying. The exams are so much more difficult than they should be. I'm counting down the days to be done with this class",
            "He taught his class for maybe a week before handing it off to the TAs who speak entirely in Spanish so you get absolutely nothing out of the lectures. He has INSANE Respondus requirements for his exams and if you make one wrong move he will fail you. There is no way to control the sound for the listening portion of exams so if you miss it, oh well.",
            "This class was absolutely horrible. He doesn't teach. You end up teaching yourself everything. Attendance is mandatory and a complete waste of time. There is quite a bit of homework and the textbook is not cheap. He also talks in Spanish all the time in a 101 level class, and no one has any idea what he's saying. Just DONT TAKE THIS CLASS.",

Our class average for the first 2 tests was a 74. We have to answer questions based on audio tracks, but the people talk really fast and are difficult to understand.",

TA's hawk over you all class ensuring your participation and god forbid you check the time on your phone, points will be taken.

Attendance was not mandatory, and all classes were posted to Panopto, including when he shows how to complete the homework.",

There were 3 tests, around 10 quizzes and around 10 homework assignments. Dr. Favre was fairly responsive to emails and provided sufficient resources to learn outside of video lectures.",

            "Prof Widener is one of the nicest and best professors I had at NC State. However, Spanish is hard for me. She gives great lectures and powerpoint for us to use, but it never really clicked for me. I will recommend taking if you have a solid knowledge of Spanish!",
            "Profe was an incredible professor. I had her online and she worked hard to keep class fun and engaging. She is understanding and cares for her students. I definitely recommend to anyone taking intro Spanish courses or intermediate.",
            "Sra. Widener was the best spanish professor I had at NCSU. She is incredibly understanding, caring, and so kind. She makes you feel extremely comfortable in class and really just wants to see you try. Definitely recommend her she's the best.",
            "Jamey Widener was an amazing and fantastic professor. She was very adaptable to online learning by creating fun and engaging work for her students. Her attitude was also caring, encouraging, and positive each class. She cares a lot about her students. MindTaps are sorta heavy, but come to class, participate, and ask questions and you will do well!",
            "I absolutely love Professor Widener. She genuinely cares about her students and makes class fun, even online. There is a lot of MindTap, but I think that's the same for every FLS class. If you show up, participate, and do your homework, you will do well. I highly recommend!!",
            "Best teacher I have had at NC State no doubt",
            "Whether you're trying to minor/major in Spanish or just need to fulfill GEP's, she is willing to work with you to get you the grade you need. The class is minimal work and she prepares you well for tests. You have to go to class to learn the material best though and you only get 5 skips. LOVED her class!",
            "Ms. Widener is the best Spanish teacher I have ever had, she truly cares about her students, and is very understanding, she helps to make class super fun. Homework is through the textbook and shouldn't take more than thirty minutes.",
            "Prof. Widener is probably the best professor I've ever had. Granted, I really like Spanish and took the class to actually learn. If you apply at least some effort, she's very reasonable and always available to help. She also really cares about students, even outside of the class.",
            "I've never done so poorly in Spanish and a lot of that had to do with her awful teaching style. (E.g., she lectures using PowerPoints with a bunch of memes but doesn't provide concise notes.) Before this class, I wanted to minor in Spanish and now I'm not sure because of how terrible my experience with her has been.",
            "Se\u00f1ora Widener is a great professor, she really makes class fun. However I found her to be a pretty tough grader on the tests. She also makes you participate a LOT in class verbally so be prepared for that",
            "Senora Widener is probably one of the best professors I've had at NCSU so far. She's passionate about Spanish and she'll explain the material until everyone gets it. She employs non-traditional methods to teach the subject which really helped me understand the material. I feel well prepared for FLS 202 thanks to her."

            "I took this class during the summer and that was by far the worst decision I've ever made. This class was extremely confusing, and I've taken Organic Chemistry before this class and it was still difficult. Makes no sense how difficult this introductory level class is.",
            "I personally liked Walter. While his class wasn't the easiest if you have a group of friends to study with or don't mind getting a tutor he isn't that bad. His teaching sometimes does get confusing with the way he explains them. Get the old tests from someone who has taken him before if you can because they help a lot in preparation for the tests.",
            "Very hard but learned a lothe was always available when I had questions",
            "A solid piece of advice: don't take this class. Professor Weare means well, but he has no idea how to teach. His lectures are hard to understand, and you have to teach yourself a lot of stuff. Be sure to take someone else, but if you can't, study off of old tests.",
            "This was the hardest class I've ever taken. Professor Weare is a good person but not the best professor. I struggled to understand what he was teaching and I ended up not doing very well. If you take this class, go to tutoring, SI, and whatever else you can to try and do well in this class. It is possible but it will be hard.",
            "If he is on your schedule for CH 101, switch to another professor. His lectures can be extremely hard to understand, he does pop quizzes on things covered in class that day, and the majority of your grade comes from exams. Save yourself and take someone else.",

He cannot teach for the life of him, which is sad because he's very intelligent and seems like a nice guy. If you get stuck with him, my only advice is to get tutoring or extra help if you wanna pass",

There is one thing I did not see mentioned here:office hours, availibiliity of time to give students, forcing all students to come & see you, & genuine care for students.",

            "The guy himself is a cool dude but his lectures are SUPER difficult. I had a friend who sat in on one of his lectures (my friend had another professor) and said he couldn't understand his lectures. Note my friend did a lot better in this class than I did. I had to get outside tutoring to do okay in the class.",
            "Worst person and teacher you can get at state. He's not fair and his grade distribution is crazy compared to the other chemistry teachers. Walter is rude to students and is condescending and lacks the ability to teach properly.",
            "If you are looking for an easy A this class isn't it--but if you're looking to learn a ton and get a clear understanding of the basics then this is a great class. Prof Weare is smart and helpful, but you have to attend classes and do your work to get a good grade.",
            "Good professor but difficult tests.",
            "Can be tough. Good prof",
            "This class was challenging but Walter is extremely knowledgeable. The tests were tough but manageable. Since this is my major I knew I needed a solid understanding of the basicsnow I feel like Ill be able to handle anything!",
            "absolutely despise this man. From the way his class is structured, to his inability to respond to student emails, and his blatant arrogance. His lectures are hard to follow, he rarely allows questions, and even if you do all your homework (and get As), you wont be prepared for his exams. Oh and then he wont respond to help you improve next time.",
            "Walt expects a lot of work to be done outside of class. He only goes over 'the essential material in lectures, but the tests are much harder than the examples from class, if they were even mentioned in class! Best advice if you have Walt: read the textbook along with lectures, take your own notes, and work out example from the book. And Good luck.",
            "I STRUGGLED in his class. I read each chapter twice and still misunderstood concepts. I gained nothing from the lectures, but you have to attend incase there is a pop quiz, which most people failed. He has raging body oder to the point that I would hold my breath when he walked by. And drinks soda ALWAYS. He doesn't believe in practice problems.",
            "His lectures are not thorough, a lot of material that must be covered but is extremely brief in class. His tests cover a lot of material that is not even touched on in lecture. much of the material I learned was self taught from reading the textbook because he did not do a good job of explaining the material or even touching on it in lecture."

            "Her grading system makes no sense at all. You'll have to post a 3 minute video answering questions & even if you answer them all logically and referencing the lecture/textbook you still won't get a good grade with NO EXPLANATION. She will take at least a week to answer your emails same goes for the TA, smh. Don't take this class with her.",
            "I love Anita! She is my favorite professor this semester. She is so nice and a lovely woman. I am so sad that she is retiring. These reviews are so mean and not true, but maybe they just had a different experience. She is a fair grader and she makes you feel much better about public speaking.",
            "DO NOT TAKE HER IF U DON'T HAVE TO, I made the mistake of enrolling with Anita. She does not care about her students at all and her grading is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen at NC State. Your grades for the discussion are completely random and done by the TA. Her rubrics are almost impossible to get above a B on for the discussions.",
            "Lots of back to back speeches and worthless assignments for a 100 level course, not much leniency. Overall speeches are pointless for how many there are.",
            "Prof. Croasmun's 2.9 rating is well-deserved. I didn't have a single grade until right before the end of the semester, and the grades that I did receive were sporadic and unexplained. She does not provide any feedback, and it seems that reasoning with her is an impossibility. Prof. Croasmun can be rude and dismissive to students seeking advice.",
            "Overall, the workload for this course was very easy. Only 1 assignment/quiz/discussion post a week and then 4 exams which were all easy. But Anita Croasmun herself isn't a great teacher. Her posted lectures aren't helpful and she never leaves feedback on assignments! Sometimes I'll get 100's on DB and sometime's 70's, but she never says why.",
            "The class was taken online, and the lectures were given out in a weekly format. Most lectures were outdated and a little boring to listen to for an hour. The tests I found on quizlet, so made it easier. She says to purchase the textbook, but I found a FREE online version on Internet Archive. Tbh I did not use it :/",
            "I swear she just picks random numbers for grades and gives no explanation whatsoever. You need a 98 in the class to get an A+. When I reached out to her for feedback I never got a response. The class itself is pretty easy. What annoyed me the most was the random grades (ranging from 20%-99% for the same effort/quality)",
            "Her online 112 class is painfully easy but is so disorganized. Her lectures are extremely outdated but you don't really need to understand the content to do well. She gave the most random grades for things with no explanation but I still ended up with an A. Most everything is on quizlet.",
            "Took Croasman for COM 112 fully online and it was super easy. The class consists of 3 exams and a final and the only homework are weekly discussion posts on TED talks which later switch to weekly quizzes. She isn't very receptive outside of class, posts all her lectures but some are reused lectures. Take her if you want the class for an easy credit",
            "I had it online, but she was still a terrible professor. She's very disorganized and changed dates from the syllabus and did not email us about it, you better just hope you notice. Also would get one-word responses when I would reach out to her via email; communication professor but her communication is awful and so is her class. Do not take her.",
            "I took an 8 week session for this class and everything felt disorganized. Every week we would be reading 100-150 pages out of the textbook. Her lectures added nothing to the course. And at the end, we had a paper and a final exam due within a few days of each other.",
            "This class was so disorganized and confusing. Even some of the information on the syllabus was wrong. No class schedule, doesn't respond to emails, takes about 6 weeks (not exaggerating) to grade assignments, uses recorded lectures as old as 2013 which have outdated examples, unclear grading criteria. Just a complete mess.",
            "I took this class as an 8 week that met only once per week due to covid precaution instead of twice. Tests are difficult but u can make up w hw and essay. There were about 3 hw's that were recordings of discussion questions. Had two TA's that also lectured along w prof, which made lectures confusing. Readings were 90-120 pgs per week.",
            "I signed up for this class and didn't realize it was going to be an 8-week class which really messed me up. The tests make up most of the grading and small assignments make up the rest which sucked because I figured that out after the fact. She will also NOT round up your grade but that just happens with some profesors.",
            "The class material was super interesting but the tests were extremely hard. Be sure to read each line of the textbook in order to be prepared for the tests. Not much hw assigned (super easy). TA's were super accessible but the professor was not. Not an easy A class (bc of tests) but if you study hard and show up to class, you should be fine.",
            "DE class was super easy, you have to answer a prompt each week but it's more like a short essay a week. Exams were easy and straight from the textbook. Not a lot of work and should be an easy A! Also, playback her lectures on 1.6x because she talks very slowly.",
            "I did not have an issue with the exams and found that prof Croasmun responded well outside of class. However the *group* essays with 4 strangers that you only have a week to work on and were graded very critically were awful. If those were removed the class would have been alright.",
            "I really liked prof Croasmun and this was a pretty easy course however you have group papers due every week and I didnt like that because your grade depends heavily on your group mates, plus your stuck with the same group mates the whole semester so if you dont like them thats tough. Exams are pretty easy if you watch lectures."

We were supposed to be going over our tests but no",

            "Memorize old tests to score well. Read the book to learn. Boring lectures. Did a good job of giving us old tests, notes, recorded lectures, all that stuff. The book agreed with class material so it was useful. 4 tests, dropped lowest one. No other grades (bc covid, I think he usually does more). Not the worst experience, summer class if you can.",

BEWARE, do NOT under any circumstance raise your hand to ask a question, those who do will be put on notice by him and he'll constantly ask to see if you understand the rest of clas",

Sitting through lecture, had to muster ALL of my effort to try to understand him (I could catch maybe 70% of what he says AT MOST when concentrating super hard) Unfortunately, while I was so focused on piecing together his accent, I wasn't really paying attention to the content. All test answers online tho...",
            "6 quizzes, 4 tests. One of each is dropped. He posts all the old quizzes and tests from previous years and pulls from those questions. I went to class pretty regularly for about a month. Then I only showed up when there were quizzes and tests. Final grade was above a 100. If you actually try to learn the material you'll probably do worse",

It is absolutely beyond me how people don't get an A in his class. Further, if you actually want to learn the material, put in some effort. Don't expect to be spoonfed",
            "Jag's class was fine. A good amount of work was needed to prepare for the exams, but they were extremely fair. Lecture materials and course text were helpful, but he is rather unorganized. Makes for a good summer class.",
            "mse200 with Jag is the easiest class I have taken at ncsu. Don't try and pay attention in class because his accent makes it impossible to track him long enough to make sense. Just do what everyone else does and cram all the old test answers in your brain and bask in the fact that the test you are taking is the same as the old tests.",
            "If you want to learn about MSE, don't take this class. If you want an A, take it. The class is only quizzes & tests. He posts years of old quizzes/tests on moodle. All tests & quizzes have extra credit. To pass quizzes, memorize answers to old quizzes he posts. To pass tests, go to his reviews & then memorize the old tests. This will get you an A.",
            "As long as you follow is lectures, practice the quizzes, assignments, and practice exams, it's a relatively easy class. I personally had to read the textbook to get a better understanding for concepts, but his exams generally follow the topics he cover in lecture.",
            "Couple of things that made this class so frustrating was his need to use old red markers on the white board and his accent.  If you sit to far back you can see anything.  His old quizzes and tests are all online so use those to study.  This class could be completely online and would be just fine.",

            "Having Ozturk for ECE200 helped, but his class was hard. He didn't really give many examples to study and his design homework assignments took AGES to complete. The tests are tough and hard to study for (again because of his few examples). Honestly the only reason I got a B+ was his insane curving policy.",
            "What a tough grader, this class really made me struggle. Ozturk has great lectures and is really passionate about his work though, which brings a lot to his class. Beware however, he doesn't teach 200 in the way they expect for 211, so you will have to learn dependent sources/current sources on your own.",
            "Ozturk is a good professor. I had him for 200 and then 211 with Veety. He does teach, his textbook is pretty good for the most part, and the tests are quite easy. He curves the test averages up to an 80%, so this class should not be hard to pass if you actually put in effort. Homework assignments are long but not too difficult.",
            "This class is not great if you have not been introduced to circuit analysis in the past. If possible, I recommend taking the Townsends. With that being said, be sure to pay close attention to the wording of his test questions, and do not use other resources for this class. There is a generous curving policy, but it is still hard to do well.",
            "Ozturk is a good professor cause he has been involved with research and has a lot of knowledge. He wrote the textbook for this class so he sticks to it. His tests are way more conceptual and often require you to actually have thorough knowledge of the course. Do not compare his way of teaching to the other professors who teach this course.",
            "Ozturk is a poor lecturer and rambles without giving explanations. His tests are extremely hard, often focusing on very specific cases that more often than not were both not covered much in class or in the book. Figuring out what he means in a problem is almost a riddle because of how he words it. He makes this class much harder than it should be.",
            "He knows what he's talking about, but is a poor lecturer. His tests are extremely difficult and he does not offer any useful information on how to prepare other than \"Understand the material\". He also comes off as unemphatic and condescending. I've heard he has a massive grading curve that saves most of the class from failing towards the end.",
            "Only take this course if it is your only choice. Tests are super hard and they are focused on fundamentals more than if you actually know how to do the problems. He can be a bit rude during office hours so just keep that in mind if you go to his office hours for help. He is an incredibly smart man, but struggled to break it down to beginner levels.",

He is nice, and he does go in-depth about the reason and history behind the stuff, but we don't need to know that. \nHe calls on people a lot. If the class does badly on a test he gets disappointed.",
            "Professor Ozturk is smart, but he cant teach. His lectures would often go way too fast for people, and he would act all confused when nobody understood what he was teaching. His tests were hard, and the final even had material he said wouldnt be covered. The only reason his grade distribution isnt lower is his insanely generous curving policy.",
            "It is actually insane how little I was prepared by this teacher for the next class. If you are absolutely unable to get into a different class, just skip his lectures and go to someone else's because you are not going to learn what you need to know for ECE211. The \"review\" in 211 in the first chapter is not review for Ozturk students, so good luck.",
            "Unable to reach outside of class or office hours with questions. The material was poorly taught, and most learning was done outside of class doing the homework. Tests were very difficult covering different material than the homework and expecting it done in a different way. Curves grades heavily so half the class doesn't fail.",
            "Unavailable. Tests on things that wasn't covered in class. Very textbook heavy; his textbook mind you. The textbook also has several errors in both the wording and the worked out problems and the sample questions for the end of the textbook. Overall a poorly taught class.",
            "If you have the option to take ECE 200 with a different professor please do so. He does not explain stuff well so you have to teach yourself through practice problems in the tacky textbook he made himself. He has to curve every exam by a ton to save his grade distribution because he cannot teach. Smart guy, terrible professor.",
            "His lectures were good for the basics, but you were left to master the material on your own. His homework was much more difficult than the examples talked about in class. His tests also got harder as the semester went on, with the final having material he didn't give us any practice on.",
            "Ozturk is not a good professor. His lectures are basically pointless and everything my friends and I learned was straight out of the book. It is impossible to do any homeworks without reading the book and his tests get progressively harder with the final having concepts we talked about for less than 2 classes and a topic we never had homework on.",
            "He was nice enough, but not a good professor. He sometimes went incredibly fast, to the point where you basically had to rewatch the lectures. The homework was often much more difficult than the examples covered in class, but prepared you well for the exams.",
            "Dr. Ozturk is a great professor! His tests are extremely difficult, but he lays out his curving policy at the beginning of the semester, and he follows that exactly. Best things: Interesting lectures, and he will meet with you outside of class if you reach out. Worst thing: He scheduled a test the day after a wellness day.",
            "Dr. Ozturk is by far the worst professor I have had at NC State in my 4 years. The exams for E304 are absurdly difficult and have lots of errors. All the exams were a lot of \"check all that apply.\" He had to curve the first exam 20 points because the average was so low. He needs to learn how to make better exams that people can interpret."

Dr. B was always willing to meet outside of class. She really knows her stuff and I understand physiology so much better after taking her classes. Great professor!",
            "Dr. B is the best professor I have ever had! She outlines the expectations very clearly and is always available for individual meetings, even in a class with almost 100 students. She is the only professor I've had who takes the time to make sure each student feels valued, and I wouldn't have gotten through the semester without her support.",

She can be rude if you ask questions without reading the emails or project instructions carefully. She is very difficult to reach by email. She takes up to a week to respond.",
            "I got a B- by studying 1-2 days before the exams because I procrastinate, but I recommend watching the videos on the schedule given to avoid the stress involved with cramming. The average on most exams is 50-60 points but the class is \"curved\" in a way that 95% will pass. Dr. B relies heavily on her videos recorded years ago and a TA to teach us.",
            "We just had our first exam and it was harder than expected. Class isn't required but I'm glad I went bc Dr.B walked us through exam type questions. The hard part about this class is you have to be self-motivated to keep up with the work but Dr.B is super helpful!",
            "Dr. Bohorquez is a great professor and is always available to meet outside of class. There's a lot of independent study required. There is a metric ton of material for each module but everything on the exams come from her lecture videos, so make flaschards on pretty much everything you see/hear in those videos.",

If you put in the time you will get good results. Dr B is a genius and more accessible than most professors. Study hard and DONT FALL BEHIND.",
            "Dr. B helped ease my anxiety about returning to campus by giving us flexibility in the course. There are so many resources available that doing well is just a matter of putting in the time. She gives little hints on exams to steer us to the right equation. This is the most comprehensive course I have taken in graduate school.",

            "Professor B is incredibly intelligent and really knows what she's talking about. You will have to work very hard in this class but she is there to help and so also curves grades. Lecture videos are absolutely crucial, study groups are very important especially since you'll have team-based quizzes. Don't wait till the last minute to understand.",
            "I'm a first year medical student and I came back to echo that nothing has prepared me for Medical school like Dr. B's Phys courses. I go back to my notes from her class to better understand the material because in med school lecturers just get worse. These courses are a chance to prove you're capable of handling professional school.",
            "The videos are very helpful and explain things well. Tests are not easy but they are about what I expected from graduate physiology courses.",
            "These classes are not easy but I didnt expect them to be. Something I appreciate is the detailed explanations Dr. B gives in the videos. All of the content that we need to know is in there. You just have to pay attention. I also like the analogies and examples she gives because it makes the material more relevant to me.",
            "Dr. B did a great job with the lecture videos. All of the information we needed to know was included, and she explained things clearly. She was always available to meet outside of class to go over the exams too, which helped me to learn how to better study. I am looking forward to the second half this spring! She is the BEST!!!",

She was always available to answer questions and explain how to think through the case study questions. I feel so much better prepared for med school now!",
            "Alright, let's be real here. The exams are like tier 5 questions, ones where you really have to think about them which can be detrimental to your thinking because she gives no hints or directions as to if your thinking process is right or wrong. She goes through lectures very quick so read the textbook to supplement info. Overall, just avoid her.",
            "The hardest part about this class is that it is not like other grad courses I have taken. Just knowing facts is not enough. You have to be able to use the information to solve a problem. I was not ready for this at the start of the semester. Now I know how to study so I really understand the material. Office hours with Dr. B are essential!"

Also, a lot of assignments and annotating.",

He is a moderately tough grader, but he gives great feedback. The class itself has so many assignments that are just busy work and there is a decently book that is required to read.",

            "If you have a hard time keeping your attention in classes, do not take Broyles' classes. He speaks extremely slow and is hard to listen to without getting distracted in the middle of sentences. If it's an a-sync class you could still be fine if you sped up the speech, though.",
            "If you are looking for a course you can just show up I would not recommend. I really enjoyed his insight, he is clearly extremely passionate, and he does make you work for the grade. If you enjoy English, definitely recommend."

Super interesting class and learned so much!",

Now, his class is heavily intensive on lectures and reading, DO NOT skimp on notes or you're done for on the papers. If you hate papers, do not take him. 3 papers, each 16-20 pages long. If that is not your style, go elsewhere.",

The tests were very straight forward but he threw in a couple of odd balls.",

His exams are basically like the practice tests with a couple more tricky questions (but nothing you can't solve while re-reading). He grades on 3 tests, homework, and a final.",

He yaps instead of actually teaches. His lectures were never helpful. He would talk during the test. The only reason I got by was by practically memorizing his practice tests.",
            "Professor Castellano's rating here is very unfair. He is a very reasonable and considerate professor. He makes the lectures easy to understand and he explains and points out what we need for the exams. Though I did well in the course, I am not a Chemistry wizard. If you do all the practice tests he posts and go to the lectures you can get an A.",

Thankfully he provides lots of practice tests that are pretty similar to the exam, but the grade is very test heavy. He does curve the final grades if needed (and it def was)",

Attending the lectures won't even help you since he doesn't explain the topics very well. also, he won't stop talking during the exam.",

Does not put up any review sheets, only posts old tests. condescending and does not explain anything well",

            "Mr. Colby is the roughest and most subtly arrogant teacher I've had. There is too much work considering most of us are taking 15-18 hours, and even on snow days he'll assign more work because he thinks you have more time. Don't bother asking him a question or email him because it is no help. If you want to pass you have to have a lot of spare time.",
            "Dr. Colby speaks in a monotone voice and can make a forty minute class feel like five hours. He spends the majority of his class time lecturing, which makes it really difficult to stay interested. Although he only assigns four essays throughout the semester (3 of which are peer-reviewed), he is generally very unclear about his grading criteria.",
            "This was probably the most difficult class that I have yet to take at NC State. Dr. Colby has an odd way to him and may seem a little vague at times with what he wants, but if you utilize office hours and actually put some effort into writing a paper you should be okay. The homework was easy and the 3rd and 4th projects were a little tricky.",
            "Would not advise to take this class.",
            "As unapproachable as Dr. Colby may seem, the key to his class is having him look over your papers during office hours.  He will grade your papers more leniently if you do, and you'll also understand the criteria better since he is terrible at explaining it in class.  He can be very rude to students when they ask questions in class, so go to his OH.",
            "Dr. Colby is a monotone, unhelpful teacher. Dont bother trying to ask him a question if you are confused on an assignment, he will respond arrogantly and make you feel like an idiot for asking it. He acts like he hates teaching the class, which makes it even worse. Do not take his English class.",
            "Requires a good amount of work: homework almost every class, four major papers and one oral presentation. Some of the paper topics seemed so un-English related I wanted to cry, but as long as you do your homework and listen in class you will understand what he is looking for. Going to office hours on your own at least once per paper can save you.",
            "Dr. Colby treats students poorly and rarely answers any questions you may have. Often I would ask for clarification, and he would respond in a condescending way every time. I would ask for help on projects, but I received none from him. It was an intro course, yet he made you feel like a moron for asking a question. Do not take his class.",
            "Dr. Colby is a good teacher-- he assigns very long papers (but only 4). He grades these pretty tough, you can miss 9 classes and still pass, and you can miss 3 classes and get your lowest grade dropped. Not a bad deal at all. If you want an A, go to office hours and he'll help you and you can get an A, if you want an easy B its easy enough.",
            "Dr. Colby is not a very good professor. He is way too arrogant and does not give much constructive criticism to help you improve your writing skills. His assignments are like trying to figure out a puzzle because he has so many different small parts. I would not recommend taking this english class.",
            "I really enjoyed this class. Dr. Colby was available pretty much anytime you wanted to meet with him. All I had to do was email him and I could meet with him about my paper. He has very specific guidelines for what he wants in his papers and if you take your paper into his office he will tell you a list of things you need to fix.",
            "Dr. Colby is very helpful and will give good grades if you go to his office hours. He likes to see that you are trying and putting effort into your papers.",
            "Really tough grader and extremely unclear about what he wants.  Doesn't really teach much other than expect you to know what you're doing off of the one example he gives you.  Will tell you how you are wrong and not doing it right but gives no explanation in how to do it right.  Avoid taking, seems like a nice guy but good luck connecting with him.",
            "Dr. Colby may be a little hard to approach, but if you work hard and drop in and see him in office hours, he will give you nice hints about what he wants to see from your papers. Not an English fan but he made it enjoyable.",
            "I don't suggest taking his class. While Colby is sort of nice, he is very unclear on what he wants in his papers, its like he develops his own types of papers for you to write.. he can be rudeisn't too awfully helpful either. If you ask something he said in class he will call you out over it which is kind of annoying. A VERY picky grader as well.",
            "He's a really cool professor. I actually hated English, but with Dr. Colby as my professor it wasn't as stressful as I thought it'd be. Dr. Colby may seem like he's boring, but the professor has a sense humor, you just got to dig it up ;)"

That being said, the labs can be pretty time consuming especially if you haven't coded before. But they are interesting prompts and prepare you well for types of code you might need in the future.",
            "I don't get the hype. Naji is funny but comes off as rude and demeaning if you ask him a question. Coming from someone with no prior coding experience, the assignments were extremely difficult and time-consuming. Spent most of my time outside of class at office hours every day. Labs were super boring and difficult. Exams were written code and hard.",

His assignments are interesting and often relate to real world biomedical engineering problems. He replies to emails within a day, and often within minutes and his door is almost always open for requestions. I cannot recommend him enough!",
            "Naji is the best professor ever! He lectures in a way that captures your attention so it's easy to listen and learn. He is so accessible outside of class and will normally respond to emails within minutes. Do not be afraid to ask him for help, he genuinely cares about seeing all of his students succeed. Take Naji for whatever classes you can!",
            "He is so sweet. The BME advisor moved to industry over the summer, and he has helped me through a lot of my scheduling. So, not only is he an amazing professor, I love his 201 class, but he is also a great temp advisor.",

While his class was quite challenging, most of the assignments were very interesting/rewarding. I would definitely recommend working in groups on projects and going to office hours!",

He is a respectable and great man that truly cares about the class and his students learning and life outside of academics.

He makes a concerted effort to respond to emails nearly instantaneously at pretty much any time of day, and pretty late into the evening. Naji expected excellence from his students and you will have to work for your grade, but he is a genuinely caring and compassionate man as well.",

The tests are a mix of math and short answer questions and require a thorough understanding of the course content.",

            "Prof. Kang is a sweet lady, but I don't really feel low-level calc is her specialty. She taught this class 10 years and got stuck with us, it was a bit of a curve ball for both of us, she tried her best. Was not able to adjust to her way of teaching even with alot of studying. She's just too smart to teach! Curves tests but low-key don't help.",
            "Dr. Kang is actually so awesome, she is super understanding and will accommodate for everyone. She teaches the course well and is funny too.",
            "I have never had a professor that put me on such an academic and emotional rollercoaster as Dr. Kang did. The first few weeks were rough, but ultimately the way she taught made me understand the material way better, she's hilarious. Her tests are insanely difficult (but curved), but if you learn to think like she does you'll do fine.",
            "Khang was a very entertaining profesor to have. She does not record lectures unless asked beforehand. She explains things clearly expect for unit 1.3 where she overcomplicates the topic.",
            "Definitely the hardest math class I have taken so far, but Min Kang always tried to make the lectures entertaining, throwing in occasional jokes. She was also supportive and cared more about students comprehending the material. Tests were definitely challenging but she does typically add a bit of a curve to the grading as needed.",
            "Dr. Kang was a great professor but in order to pass her class you need to attend lectures and do all of your work on time. She doesn't extend homework assignments ever which was difficult for my mental health but otherwise a great lecturer. She's really funny too. Her tests are hard but as long as you practice you'll be good.",
            "Cannot say enough good things about Min Kang! Her lectures are entertaining, informative, and helpful. She truly cares about her students and teaching the material thoroughly. Her tests are incredibly difficult, but if you work hard in her class - your grade will reflect that! Easily the best course and teacher during my entire college career!!",
            "Dr. Kang is absolutely brilliant, but it was a rough class for a few reasons. Dr. Kang is very dialed into upper level mathematics that most of us will never touch and seemed like she wanted to breeze through concepts without going through examples. 2 of 3 test averages were also in the 60s. But if you're dedicated to the elegance of math, take her",
            "She is a great and caring professor. She makes the class enjoyable although her lectures definitely felt long some days. She makes a point for us to understand that she wants us to learn and that our grade is not a reflection of the material and the course. Her exams are tough compared to other professors, so it is no easy A but it was worth taking",
            "The class is difficult and she knows it so your grade is more of a reflection on how much you have learned and how serious you are about the class, not necessarily how well you do on exams. She's a funny prof who makes sure her students understand the how and why behind the concepts. You def need to be good at real analysis to do well in class.",
            "Prof is very kind and makes sure you actually understand the concepts instead of learning formulas. She maps out her proofs (in 10 different colors) but doesn't ever write down full proofs, which can be confusing when you look back at the notes. That being said, this is real analysis, which is a hard subject to learn no matter who teaches it.",
            "She did a good job explaining the material as well as working with you when you were struggling.",
            "Don't be afraid to ask questions! She actually gives you good explanations. She hates a quiet class and at first she might be intimidating, but you figure out that she is an awesome teacher. Don't get too bogged down if you don't understand something at first bc she usually explains it later. Stay on top of hw and do lots of practice problems.",
            "This is the second time I've had Dr Kang and she is one of the best professors I've had. She really cares about her students and wants them to succeed and at the same time she will make sure we understand the beauty and greatness and complexity of the subject. Her tests are hard, but if you study hard, she will make sure your grade reflects that.",
            "She was excited to teach us. The tests were simple. We didn't finish the entire course material (missing greens theorem) but focused on trying to make sense of the 3d world.",
            "Dr Kang was AMAZING. I loved the way she explained things- really wanted you to know the math behind everything. She was also super funny and I was always laughing so hard in class. She was just an absolute gem! Her tests were a bit of a challenge, nothing super hard, but I think having her as a professor made the difficult exams totally worth it.",
            "Dr. Kang is noticeably a genius, and if you look her up on Google her profile comes up. She seems to be one of the only professors I've heard of that is great at her research but also cares about her students. If you need help with something, she's available after class and encourages you, but also problem sessions with the TA help. Love her humor!",
            "Dr Kang is a wonderful lecturer and a really caring professor, but the tests are not easy.",
            "Dr. Kang is one of the smartest and most caring math professors I've ever had. She explains everything super well and is willing to go over material until her students understand. The tests were challenging, but nothing too terrible if you PAY ATTENTION IN CLASS and do practice problems from the textbook. Don't take if you want an easy A (duh)",

Don't take this class if you care about your mental health, emotional wellbeing, and GPA.",

He would take time to talk with each group and really made you feel heard.  He would give hints if needed and was always open to help you in the right direction.",

He often asks open questions to the class to get feedback on a topic, just answer with whatever comes to mind and you will enjoy the lectures a lot more as a conversation.

Harsh grader",

            "Attendance is MANDATORY, will get mad at you if you're late. 2 lates = absence, 6 absences = fail. The women-to-men ratio of my class was 3:5 (6:10). Class is set up by a similar strength partner punching the bag on opposing sides. I did S/U grading bc midterm & final = hard (txtbk). 3 finals: 20 min 2 mile run, 3 min strike test, txtbk chapters.",
            "(HESM 480) The professor did not value the course, as it was online with 5 quizzes and many discussion posts. The final exam accounted for 50 points/total of 128 points and the material was not a reflection of the course. I kept an A+ all semester until the final brought me to a C when I received a 50%. My peers received D's and he did nothing.",
            "Great teacher, good enthusiasm, great workouts and pushes you to do better physically. Does not teach only mentions some material. A weight training course where none of the grades are based on the actual training with weights. 3 test all based on the textbook of which no material mentioned in class. Not a well structured/graded course. Take P/F",
            "I often struggle to keep up in classes like this, but class was supportive and lighthearted. Explains stuff well and takes time to go over fundamentals, and ramps up difficulty to prep for tests. Will let you mod exercises if you ask and need to, but still be ready for a workout! Ask any questions in person because email responses are hit-or-miss.",
            "The professor is nice and encouraging. Your only grades are three exams and a wall sit test. The wall sit test wasn't bad but the other exams were more difficult. They are fully based on the textbook and some questions can be very specific. The final was very hard. The exams reflect almost nothing you do in class which was very annoying.",
            "This class isn't probably what you think it is. It has cardio workouts in every class basically throughout the semester, so be ready for that. The two exams are easy but the final physical tests are hard for non-athletes you have a speed-strike test and 20 minute run. Would recommend that most people take this class S/U.",
            "The only problem is that the attendance policy is kind of strict (but I always tended to show up so this wasn't a problem for me). He was funny during class and made the workouts a good difficulty. The exams were not as bad as they were made out to be, just read the textbook/listen to what he says in class, and take the class P/F and you'll be fine",
            "Coach Thompson's class was very fun and very beginner friendly in terms of weightlifting and he's a very nice guy. The course grading however sucks. You get 3 exams (90%) and a 3 minute wall(10%) sit for your entire grade. Exam content is ONLY in the textbook it will not be covered in class. Fun class overall but I would recommend taking pass/fail.",
            "Coach Thompson is a cool dude. The music he plays during class is... interesting LOL. Classes are strictly lifts. The tests are on the textbook which we don't go over AT ALL in class. I took this class for credit and did fine. If you don't think you'll make much progress lifting/don't think you'll do well on tests I would definitely take it P/F.",
            "Friendly guy. Keeps class judge-free since all are at different levels (when it came to weightlifting). Class seems scary at first but it's not that bad at all. Only negative is the strict attendance. I had to attend a funeral in NJ and could not get an excused absence for that. You only get 5 absences for the semester, anything more and you fail.",
            "The class and professor are fine however I very much do not recommend taking the class in the early morning as it is quite physically demanding and you will sweat. The tests are unnecessarily difficult and sometimes not even focused on the textbook but rather on random things he mentions in class. Only take this class P/F.",
            "A really diverse class full of people of all levels, and he is very encouraging to beginners and experienced. Three exams and a fitness test make up the grade, so I would recommend Pass/Fail, but if you do the readings and are able to do a decent wall sit, a B is super easy to obtain. Plays VERY annoying music though (haha). Would do it again!!",
            "Great teacher, cares about his students, is fun, classes were never boring, doesn't make the class harder than it needs to be, you know exactly what you have to do to pass the class, overall just a fun and caring teacher that made my morning workout class bearable.",
            "Marcus Thompson was a great professor for weight training when it came to class but his written midterm and final were impossible and based off random portions of the textbook that were never taught. Also, the final is based on how much weight you can lift so you have to really make progress. Fun class but very annoying grading system.",
            "Take this pass/fail. I passed. Classes are fine but the fitness test at the end is really hard. Extremely strict on attendance, even for illness. Overall, a nice guy who knows his stuff, and it's a fun class too. Just never be late or absent if you can help it.",
            "TAKE THIS PASS/FAIL. It's an easy class but your final grade only comes from a midterm, final exam, and fitness tests. The fitness tests are unrealistically difficult to pass especially if you don't have prior lifting experience. This course is great for building strength and is low stress as long as you take it pass/fail.",
            "I enjoyed his class! Beware that attendance is a huge deal & don't be late. I had 0 weight training experience b4 taking this class but I feel more confident in my ability to workout & learned a lot. There's only 2 exams & the bench press, leg press, & lat pulldown grades. I took this for credit & ill probably have a B-. He's pretty chill too!",
            "Don't buy the textbook all you need to know is on his powerpoints. The class was meh tbh",
            "If you want some tough but rewarding workouts I would definitely take this class. I took it over the summer so it was m-th and our class got really close. It was fun workouts and built up my stamina.",
            "Mr. Thompson is a cool guy who knows his stuff. He does a great job of teaching the fundamentals of nutrition and weight training in a way that is fun and engaging. If you do not have prior lifting experience, I would consider taking this class pass/fail. If not, it should be fairly easy."

Just do all the homework which is not hard, and you will pass the tests and daily quizzes. You will have to do studying, but that's a given when learning a language, and it's fun with this class if you are truly interested.",
            "Get ready for one of the hardest 101 language classes! Ueda-sensei is the absolute best, but this class is pretty difficult if you've never studied Japanese before. You should at least study a bit of Hiragana before the semester if you want to do well. Ueda-sensei requires her students to participate in class, and she can be really picky on grading",
            "Ueda-sensei is caring and kind but doesn't take any nonsense. If you don't practice and study at home, she will know. Pop quiz every day. That being said, her class is hilarious. She heavily encourages pair work. The class isn't hard if you study. Ueda-sensei was literally the highlight of my day when I had her class.",
            "Ueda sensei was really organized and definitely helped me grasp the basics of Japanese. You have a quiz everyday, but they are really short. Memorize the material and you'll do fine. Tests aren't too bad but the listening can be hard. Overall, really good class and the way she teaches is probably the only way to learn so much in so little time.",
            "Ueda-sensei is fantastic! She's strict, yes, but for good reasons. She just expects you to show up everyday and to do the work--that's not unreasonable at all. In fact, I think her style makes you learn. She may seem intimidating sometimes, but she's actually approachable and kind. She will meet with you personally and give intesive support! :)",
            "Her class is extremely structured, and I found that a great thing. There is usually a quiz every class, but if you pay attention and do the homework, you will do fine on them.",
            "She's a great professor. Lots of people say she's strict. It's true that she can be a very picky grader, but she isn't unreasonable. Class is a whole lot of fun, but expect to put in a lot of time for homework. If you know the material, you won't have any trouble on the tests, because all of the work she assigns will prepare you for the tests.",
            "So awesome! I miss her teaching style now that I have Sera sensei. She has a very strict class routine so you'll always know what to expect. Every day you have homework, but that's typical for a beginner language level.",
            "Ueda-sensei is smart, funny, and a fantastic teacher. But don't get on her bad side! If you skip class a lot, don't pay attention, or don't want to participate or do homework, you're gonna have a bad time. 46 hiragana in Japanese + 46 katakana + 43 kanji we memorize in this class  a huge pain to memorize if you don't actually want to do the work",
            "She's super nice and actually makes the class really interesting! Every class you must participate so be prepared to talk.",
            "Great teacher. Gives lots of homework and tests get longer as the semester goes on, but they're not hard. Need to study material before class because she calls on everyone around five times per class.",
            "Makes you work. Lots of homework. Tests aren't hard, she gives a review sheet for all tests. Lot of the grade is up to flow/fluency, speak and participate; practice; she wants you to form relationships within the class which is nice; she cares about her students a lot. shes quick to respond to emails but really strict on attendance.",
            "Ueda sensei is a very good teacher! Although that isn't to say she does all the work for you- as a student, she expects for you to put in the time and effort learning. Excellent teacher, demanding class. Not a \"101\" or easy class in any sense (assuming you have no prior experience to Japanese.)",
            "Hilarious teacher but can be very intimidating at times (especially when she asks you to answer something in class). She is nice though and approachable. Class was easy for me, but not so easy for my friends. Be prepared to put in some effort.",

            "One of my favorite professors of all time.  The quizzes are easy, the tests are easy, and the classes are very enjoyable.  She is such a sweet teacher and I will always remember her.  I wish she also taught higher levels of Japanese :(",

Tests are VERY textbook heavy (most is vocab from book) and other half is based on lectures. My advice: take notes on the lectures; sometimes there are questions about things only mentioned once or twice. Bluebooks will be your best friend.",
            "I loved Dr.Khan however her class isn't the easiest but nothing too bad. Attendance isn't required however she does have a few required attendance days (she will let you know beforehand). You really need to read the textbook if you want a good grade, the exams are straight from that (we can use notes on our exams). Overall, it's an ok class!",
            "This was the first class where the professor related the topics to the industry. She brought in alumni to talk to the class to give perspective on life after graduation in IT consulting and start building professional network. We also learnt to use AI in the class, which was pretty cool.",
            "Khan isn't just another teacher, she cares about student success. Her passion for IT shows and she makes sure you get the help when needed. Plus, the grading is clear and the feedback helps. I went to her to get guidance in doing well in the exams, and it helped me allot. If you want a professor who's invested in your success, take her class.",
            "She is very condescending and snarky about her remarks towards students. She is not an easy grader as she does pay attention to minute details when grading and will take off points for little things. She will not let you resubmit assignments if you turn in a wrong file. You must read the textbook to do good on the tests.",
            "Make sure to keep track of all of your assignments, as there can be a lot of different things to handle at times. READ THE TEXTBOOK. If you do not read the textbook, you will not do well on the tests, as they are taken mostly from the readings. Attend lectures even though they are not mandatory, as there is lecture info covered on the tests too.",
            "super helpful professor! everything you need for the exams is in the textbook and in-class activities, and you can use a bluebook on each exam so be sure to take good notes in the bluebook as you read. if you come to class, she shows you exactly how to do each of the weekly practice assignments, so those should be easy As",
            "She cannot communicate effectively. I don't even know her preferred method of contact because she keeps going back and forth. Her messages are condescending and snarky, even failing to address questions you may have asked her. Assignments are poorly detailed and explained. If you dont go to class, EVEN ON NON-MANDATORY DAYS you WILL MISS OUT.",
            "The course itself is challenging but the way it is structured with all the resources makes it easy. Grading criteria is clear. There is work every week as long as you keep up its an easy A. I started to slack and Dr. Khan reached out to me and worked with me to bring me to speed. Show her you are willing to work and she will work with you.",
            "This professor is a very hard headed person i submitted all my assignments while having an A in the class then I check my final grade posted and it was a D. I emailed her about it and she did absolutely nothing so i did a whole semesters work for nothing. I now have to retake this class just because she messed up with my grade.",
            "She cares a lot about her students and offers as much help as she can give. I thoroughly enjoyed her class, and I felt like I retained a lot of the information given to me. There are a lot of group work and projects, so be ready for that. Reading the textbook was really helpful for her exams, and she gives you a lot of resources to help study.",
            "Dr Khan is the most organized person I have ever met. This course is run like a checklist.  Tick EVERY single box, you're going to get a good grade.  Miss one box, meh. Miss two or three? You're going to sink.  I missed several, she helped me catch back up. As a non-traditional student, I appreciate her effort.",
            "One of the kindest and most caring people I have met at NC State. Dr Khan is a little intimidating at first.  Just talk with her. She cares.  She really cares about students.",
            "Grades are weighted nicely. If you turn things in with a C average/better, you'll most likely pass the class. Professor isn't my favorite. She's very detailed, tech savvy, and at times, can be picky. Especially, with terminology. She doesn't believe in mental health so don't expect her to be caring if you needed time to take care of yourself.",
            "Sarah Khan is a straight professional. She takes the class seriously and gives you all you need to succeed. The class itself isn't too difficult, with homework and projects making a large bulk of the grade.",
            "There is weekly homework/quiz assignments to be done for this class which isn't difficult as long as you read the book and pay attention to the lectures/instructional videos.  She has a dry sense of humor and isn't afraid to roast the class for not watching instructional videos before class that had me laughing. Great Prof, would take again :)",
            "I loved this professor! She was on top of everything and was always there if you needed help with assignments. Barely any homework and exams were easy. At the end of the semester, she gave us a list of things we could add to our resume from what we learned in the class. She is so nice and I learned a lot from her, I'd recommend!",
            "Dr. Khan was a very insightful professor who really cared about what she did. I had her for BUS 340 as well. Her exams are moderately difficult but as long as you study and ask questions you will be fine. They are also not a big weight on your grade so even if you bomb one, you can still get an A. The assignments are easy. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!",
            "Very easy to understand because of her explanations. Exams are straight from the textbook. Highly recommend!",
            "Khan is good prof and class is straight forward. Tests are mostly based off of textbook reading. Fair grader and a kind person but she is not super understanding of student situations outside of class. She can also be a little judgmental of questions you may ask which hurts when you're confused and just want to learn. Overall not bad though."

She does pull a lot of questions from the textbook so even though the textbook assignments are optional you should probably do them.",
            "If you are like me and Dr. Kogan is the only instructor you can take, listen up. Her lectures are somewhat hard to follow, but if you do all the work she assigns, you'll be fine. All of her hardest test questions came straight from the textbook. If you understand all of the textbook problems that she assigns, you could literally ace every exam.",

Webwork is awful though cause some problems are impossible and most people just cheat.

She teaches everything on the tests but tends to take more time than necessary to explain some topics. One long homework assignment per week, and she'll extend it for you if you ask before it's due.",
            "She overcomplicated simple topics, was hard to hear/understand, and frankly was kinda rude. At some point in the semester, I stopped attending classes and started teaching myself (got a 96.75% test average). However despite understanding the topics and having a good grade in the class, the final was worth 35% and hard with confusing answer choices.",
            "After the first two weeks, I stopped going to lecture because they are completely useless. She way overcomplicates things and her hour 15 minute lectures could probably be condensed into 20 minutes lectures. We spent so long learning about springs that we didn't even get to finish the whole course (eg. Laplace transform). Do not take with her.",
            "Tbh I thought this class was pretty straight forward. Exam questions weren't too difficult. There are only 2 exams, so lots of content on the exams and they are 50% of your grade and final is 35%. I thought she taught well, and she's very generous with homework extensions as long as you ask before friday at 5PM.",
            "The professor is highly knowledgeable and passionate about the subject but struggles with teaching due to a focus on theory and disorganized notes. Tests have challenging theory-heavy multiple choice sections, while short answer is straightforward. The notes are pre-assembled and never get posted, and they also lack helpful examples for homework.",
            "Very boring lectures, but she over-explains a lot, so if you can sit there and listen to boring teachers this is the class for you. She also has a thick accent and wears a mask, so she's hard to understand. There are only two tests so if you screw up on one it's kind of hard to catch up. Would not take her again.",
            "Its disappointing how she is the \"better\" professor in this class. Can't understand her through her accent and wears a mask so it's even harder. Two tests determine 50% of the grade so if you mess up you're out of luck. Ended up just watching the honors prof. lectures instead and taught myself for the tests. Don't take her if you can help it.",

The tests are very forgiving, very straight-forward, and reasonably easy. For the free response, she usually uses one of the long questions from the online assignments, so study those.",

Makes a lot of careless mistakes and seems all over the place during lecture. Tests were easy but the final and assignments were relatively difficult. The material itself is easy - just take it with someone else :)",

            "The class is very straightforward.  Everything on the test is either from the book or the powerpoint (usually both).  Dr. Pond is a nice guy, kinda weird sometimes though.  The class is really boring though, DO NOT take it at 8am.  He never lets class out early.",
            "READ THE BOOK. Very nice guy. Clearly knew his stuff and explained it well. Gave a lot of examples in class about the concepts. It would be nice to have a homework portion to the grade so that you know that we are trying even if the test grades dont reflect it. Had a hard time staying awake.",
            "He is sometimes a good teacher but his lectures rarely have much to do with the test which are basically tests on the chapters in the book. read the book read the book read the book is all i gotta say",
            "If you read the textbook, go to class (use clicker), there is enough extra credit points that there is no reason you shoudln't get an A. At the same time he provides a good overview of Psychology. Defiently a good class.",
            "Dr. Pond's very boring, but nice. It's hard to stay awake in his class, but if you do the work you can get an A. You HAVE to read the book and take notes because he doesn't cover some of the stuff in his lectures. PRINT OFF THE NOTES before class so you won't have to waste time copying and can write what he says. Write & study the clicker ?'s down!",
            "Dr. Pond is very boring and it's hard to stay awake, but it's easy to get an A if you do the work.

PRINT OFF THE NOTES before class so you can take notes on what he says instead of wasting time copying.",
            "Dont get this class at 8:00 am, it gets boring. but pond himself is really nice, and you learn a lot in the class. if you study the online powerpoint you get an  A, no homework, no reading. chill class."

All exams and quizzes are very straightforward so as long as you memorize ALL notes you took in class you'll be just fine. Show up, pay attention, and take good notes!",

He has pop quizes throughout and 4 exams, which are pretty difficult. He gives a lot of extra credit at the end. If you have an issue go talk to him and he will make something work. He is very caring.",

            "10 PopQuizzes (only random at the beginning/he tells you when) usually 2 are free 100s, lowest is dropped. Beware the wording on the questions made it so confusing and exams hard. Studyold quizzes and look up old exams on quizlets (almost identical) He gives LOTS of extracredit at the end like i went from a 94 to a 98 on the final bc of extracredit",

Lectures are very monotone and boring. He does care for his students and gave us several \"free 100\" quizzes since many people were not doing great.",

I think the class was enjoyable and the only things in the gradebook are 10 quizzes (first few were unannounced), 3 exams & the final exam. The quizzes were all 10 questions and exams were 50 questions. As long as you pay attention in the lectures and study what it on the slides you will do well.",

He does have \"pop quizzes\" but they are pretty much straight forward if you pay attention in class. Definitely recommend taking animal nutrition with him!",
            "Dr. Fellner was a joy to see in the mornings. His lectures weren't too dense and he would often play cute or interesting videos that would relate to the lectures. We did have \"pop quizzes\" but he ended up telling us when to expect them or would let us take them at home. Wish I could take him again!",
            "Dr. Fellner is such a caring and compassionate professor which is refreshing. Lectures are straightforward and his tests/quizzes reflect this same level. You can openly tell he is passionate about his subject, and he loves student interaction so be sure to chat with him outside of class about what interested you! Oh he plays cute animal videos too.",
            "Dr. Fellner is an angel among us here at NC State. I could tell he was passionate about nutrition. He focused on students actually learning instead of just memorizing information for a test and would show us cute videos in class. Overall he made the class a pleasant, nonstressful experience. Go and pay attention in class and you will be just fine.",

            "Fellner was one of the best professors Ive ever had at NCSU. He is so passionate about his class and it is clear how much he cares for his students. I was worried going into this class as I was not sure Id be very interested in the material, but he made it all so interesting and kept me engaged through the semester. He was great even with covid!",

It takes a little bit more thinking to understand the material so that you get the questions right. Fellner is one of the nicest teachers that I have ever had, he sends thoughtful emails every weekend to lighten the stress of school",
            "Fellner was probably the best professor I've ever had. I was in the unmentable semester and he was great at converting the class to online. He cared about our mental health, our grades while also still teaching us useful information. Now this wasn't a free A you have to pay attention and take notes, but if you missed info he is happy to help.",

Almost all test information can be found in lecture slides that he provides online, but there may be additional things he adds to in-class presentations, so better to attend class. Pop quizzes at the beginning of the year, end of year they become scheduled. Awesome prof!"

Lectures were always clear, homework and quizzes were tedious but not difficult, and tests used questions from practice problems and were straightforward. If you spend time practicing, this is an easy course.",
            "Dr. Paul was a pretty average professor, he only gave us 6 homeworks and no projects which is far less intense than other stats classes from what I've heard. His lectures were pretty boring and I watched most of them online and still did fine. His quizzes can be quite annoying, but he gives plenty of helpful study material.",
            "Paul is really kind and genuinely cares for his students. His tests and homework assignments are very straightforward and really similar to his class examples. His lectures are easy to understand and include a lot of detailed examples. One of my favorite professors this semester - definitely recommend this course.",
            "Genuinely cares about students... but that's it. Lectures were boring and bounce between poorly made PowerPoints and disjoint hand written notes. You walk in understanding a concept and walk out confused. Exams are basically reused prompts from examples/homework/quizzes. Not many assignments and weighted poorly so not much room for error.",
            "Code is printed out and handed to us in class. The instructor doesn't understand the code given out in class because when asked about it he responds with \"I don't know\". The moodle is messy and hard to navigate. The lectures are very disengaging and focuses the majority of lectures on material we are not tested on or given homework on.",
            "Paul is an exact 3/5 professor. His lectures were boring and I felt that he wasn't the best at some explanations, but it was clear that he cared for his students. Around 7-ish homeworks which were all pretty similar to what was done in class. Two tests and a final which didn't typically have any surprises, but not a lot of room to make mistakes.",

I would take him again because he knows me by name and would have sweet stories of his family he would tell after many lectures. \nWe ended class early very often and he canceled a few classes because he taught content well and efficiently.",
            "Do not take this class if you want to learn anything. He rambles about nothing for an hours. The exams are ridiculously long, he does not prepare you at all. You will not Learn how to use Rlab but you have to know how to use on tests. His examples make 0 sense. He makes quizzes 45+ t/f and multiple choice with 1hr. DO NOT TAKE",
            "Regression Analysis is arguably the most important statistic class, and Paul is unarguably the worst professor in the department. Lectures are useless and unorganized, homeworks are LONG, unclear, and randomly assigned (claims HW only takes an hour, more like 5 hours), 3 exams that aren't easy. AVOID at all costs; I guarantee you'll learn nothing.",
            "Took as a 5 wk summer course online. 1 to 2 lectures/day, mon-fri, 1 hw/wk, 1 quiz/wk. Material was not too hard, but Dr. Paul did not explain material for test 2 cohesively (many specific conditions w/ different processes you have to map out yourself). Fair tests, no curve/extra credit. Raw score was a B+ (~88.6%), but final grade curved to A-.",
            "First time I had issues staying awake consistently in lectures in college. Material is dry and you were honor bound to not cheat on the assignments. Homeworks and tests and quizzes worked out online, none too difficult but you have to make yourself pay attention in class so you can do well otherwise. Professor cares, but the class is bland.",
            "The lectures were recorded from a year ago, but they were alright. The class itself is easy, but the tests are very long (gives you 4 hours to finish it). The last half of the semester he stopped posting solutions to the worksheets, so you'll have to go to office hours to see if you understand it. Didn't seem like he put much effort in online.",
            "Dr Paul was a good teacher. Good lectures and notes, but some material was in the lectures and doesn't end up on the notes. Book helps with understanding. Fair tests. Hw helps prepare u for the tests/quizzes effectively. Accent v intelligible. Can be a tad boring in lecture but u can only make stat so interesting. Similar material to AP stat in hs",
            "Extremely lecture heavy as the presentations themselves only have bullet points / diagrams and have very few examples worked out. Gave us plenty of practice worksheets, but none of the answers, making the extra practice worthless. Exam questions were worded extremely vaguely. Very little communication from the professor throughout the semester.",

He is caring (let us out and told personal stories) but when asked questions didn't give me satisfying explanations, more along the lines of \"this is the theory\" or \"here is the algebra.\" I did not attend office hours. Tests seemed fair. Reading the textbook helped somewhat.",

He definitely knows what he is talking about, sometimes talks in circles, but is always willing to explain more. Definitely recommend Paul!",
            "Easy grader so no chance of failing but do not take if you want to actually understand statistics. Half the stuff isn't on his slides (only videos) and some things he doesn't go over at all!

            "Very approchable and supportive guy. Teaches fairly well however I found that I needed more in-depth explanations from external sources rather than just relying on lectures. I wish I read the textbook more. Extremely picky grader, it's very easy to get a 50 on a quiz from a small mistake. Always attend class. Some extra credit, but not much.",
            "Statics is hard but Welton makes it much more bearable. It's true that quizzes can be unforgiving, but if you rework the homework you will do fine (same for tests). Oftentimes quizzes are just homework/textbook problems with the forces slid around so if you focus on the concept instead of the problem itself then you'll do well.",
            "Welton is one of the best professors I've had. He is caring and is very accessible outside of class. His lectures are entertaining and very beneficial. The only downside is that tests and quizzes are strictly graded on correct answers so it's easy to do bad. If you put in the work every day you will do fine.",
            "Insanely caring professor who only wants you to succeed. Lectures are easy to follow and usually just practice problems. Only downside is a quiz every Friday. He drops your two lowest, but the quiz is only a question or two so it's really easy to get a 40-60% from a minor mistake",
            "Mr. Welton is a respected professor at State, but statics is hard. He does physical demonstrations of statics concepts in-class, which I found to be really valuable. However, lectures are unorganized and his thought process isn't obvious when solving examples. There's a quiz every Friday and occasional pop quizzes (and they're difficult).",

There are plenty of practice problems to make sure you know what you are doing. He gives weekly quizzes. Plenty of office hours and is very sweet and accessible. Made me feel comfortable to ask questions in class.",
            "Crystal clear explanations of concepts (with demonstrations). Lectures are not burdensome, and uses example problems to show concepts. Gives lots of homework for statics (he wants us to practice problems a lot). Nice guy, and wants students to succeed. 100% recommend. He's willing to talk outside class and gets back to emails quickly.",
            "Messy lectures. Desperately needs to clearly define the step by step procedure of different types of problems but instead it ends up being a big glob of numbers and equations and tables which only he can follow. Final had some problems which were unlike anything he worked through with the class. Nice guy, just didn't teach this course well imo.",
            "The homework problems are similar to the ones done in class, but slightly harder. There are weekly quizzes, which are just like the homework problems, and the tests are based on the quizzes. So if you understand what is going on in class you will do fine. He is also great at responding to questions and finding ways to help you understand everything",

His lectures are extremely helpful and he always leaves time to go over questions asked by students. There is a quiz every week but he grades fair and is very open about what will be on them. If taking statics, take with him!!",
            "His lectures were very helpful and he gave as many examples as he could to help the students understand the material. The homework and in-class problems were often VERY similar to the ones on quizzes or tests, so taking the time to do and understand them was very helpful. Overall, he was a nice person and an amazing professor.",
            "Professor Welton goes through so many examples in class and they are sometimes even identical to homework and test questions. I was worried about the weekly quizzes at first, but they really help you to prepare for the test and know what you understand and don't. He does a great job simplifying complicated concepts and welcomes questions in class.",
            "Prof. Welton is a very good lecturer. With Statics, you must put in the work outside of class or you won't pass with any professor. Welton's lectures are enjoyable and he is a nice guy. He grades tough and makes you work for it, but this is probably because you use every single skill learned in statics for the next courses. Study for the quizzes.",
            "Great guy overall! He did his best to teach the material and did well with it. He is a solid choice and very easy to get along with outside of class too.",

He doesn't take attendance but there are quizzes every week so you better go! Definitely choose him over any other statics prof. A bit of homework but it helps you out in the long run. Don't buy the physical textbook .",

Loves to tell long stories that don't help you on the test. 2 test and a final, 25 MC and 3 problems. Completely random material tested on. Test problems are never like the hw. He provides minimal resources and the",

He's a really cool guy and you hear some really interesting stories. Not sure if I'd take him for intermediate, but for 411 he's great.",

He always has an interesting story that pertains to the topic at hand and even though his voice sounds very serious,  he can be funny at times too.   If you have the opportunity to take him, do it.  He's a great guy.",

She is also very accessible outside of class for help. Would recommend.",

She allows one index card (front/back) on exams & this helped my testing anxiety. She also replaces your lowest grade with the final if it is better! She cares about her students!",

She allows for note cards on the tests and goes over exactly what you will be tested on, question-question, never leaving you in the dark. Best math teacher I've ever had in my entire life.",

They're the same material that will be on the test and she tells u what questions will be on exams. She truly cares ab her students!",

Always informed us of the topics we would see on the exams so we could better prepare and study the important things. Helpful review material and always answered questions outside of class! Take her as your professor :)",

She is easy to reach outside of class and genuinely wants you to understand and do well. She writes pretty fast, but all notes and lectures are posted on Moodle",

The class was fast because it was during the summer but Catie was so kind and patient and understanding. I never liked math until now. I even feel like I'm kinda good at it. You won't regret taking a class with her!!",

Do the HW, practice tests and actually ask if you need help!",

I mean this woman was on the 8th step of the problem before you could even write the question down. She seriously writes SUPER fast.

He responds to emails fast and is decently lenient with grades, but that interaction left a bad taste in my mouth. He also put in a progress report for me for having a C+ in the class, WHICH IS PASSING. Bad experience & hard material.",
            "Had minimal interaction with Dr. Stern. Completing online Spanish homework is 60% of your grade (relatively easy), recording yourself and having a convo w him on Zoom (be prepared), and ONLY 2 TESTS. Genuinely a nice guy, but this course is kinda hard in general. I was GOOD @ spanish in HS, but struggled in this class some. Online makes it harder.",
            "AWFUL! Do not take this class unless youre already really good at Spanish because u will learn absolutely nothing. Only posts 2 minute long lectures that dont even help. U r basically expected to teach yourself everything from the online work and book. Rude and doesnt care about students even if u ask for help. Only 2 exams and each r worth 30%",
            "This rating is for the literal ONE WEEK I had him before he got replaced by another FLS teacher. He makes you participate whether you want to or not, gives good feedback when you say something incorrectly, but is incredibly rude when someone asks a dumb question. Also, the course material difficulty level takes a drastic leap from FLS 102 to 201.",
            "Professor Stern has a hard exterior but it is clear that he cares for his students. Participation in class, as well as the homework, helps you to understand the material and the tests are very straightforward. He cares about showing up to class prepared, and make sure you practice the pronunciation of words beforehand. Easy A if you put in work!",
            "I've had some Spanish background in my life, but no formal learning. Stern is has CLEAR expectations, everything is clearly outlined in the syllabus. All compositions sent out in advance. If you do your homework and prepare for tests, this class is an easy A. EASIER TESTS THAN ONE FLS 201 PROFS!!!!!!",
            "I took this class online, so don't expect to be taught anything; he doesn't post lectures, so you teach yourself. There are five or six exams throughout the semester, and they aren't too bad, but he doesn't give much feedback except \"go see tutor for help on ___\". If you're looking for a professor that is enthusiastic and helps, keep looking.",
            "I have taken 3 FLS courses and never learned anything until this class. I made a 90 or above on every test and didn't go out of my way to do anything extra. He does require a lot of participation and he calls on you to do examples throughout the class which made me nervous but it helped me learn better. Not a tough grader. Overall good professor",
            "Professor Stern is often times really rude. The MindTap assignments and the book are really all you will get to learn the material in this class, as his lectures are not really helpful. He is a lenient grader on the tests and in office convo. If Spanish is not your strong suit, I do not think this class would be best for yu",
            "Very hard to communicate with always responding with minimum effort. You can tell he just wants the pay. Took it online hislectures were 2-4min each week with him just reading slides. Didnt teach anything the entire time. Always responding with smart comments to my msgs. Do NOT take this class. Better off just using the book and teach yourself.",
            "Stern will expect good attendance and participation, and make sure to do all the hw. You will need to follow along and speak in front of the class. He can seem rude sometimes but is a good guy. Fair grader and answers any questions you may have. Try not to fall behind because he wants the class to make progress each lecture. Study for the final.",
            "Even though I took this online, Dr. Stern seemed like a very nice guy at the final. There is quite a bit of homework and five tests before the final, but it can all be done at home, including the tests. He is not a tough grader and will give feedback on what you did wrong for the conversations and writing compositions and the final wasn't too bad.",
            "He is an intimidating professor at first, and expects participation every class period. It can be tough to speak in front of the class at first, but it helps a lot in class. He can be socially unaware at times and even seem rude, but he is really understanding outside of class if you have issues, especially with absences. He's a VERY lenient grader",
            "Stern is a very difficult teacher. This class was not easy and I strongly do not recommend taking it online. There is a lot of work and if you procrastinate it is rough. Tests are totally fill in the blank and free response. If Spanish isn't your strong point then know it will require a lot of studying. He is a fair teacher, but not easy.",
            "HE does a lot of reading around the class. He will generally have everyone speak the whole class by going around the room. His notes are disorganized and handwriting is hard to read, but he gives as much credit as he can on questions on quizzes and tests. I never studied or did homework and still got As on everything.",
            "Ton of homework, but extremely fair in grading and gives you a lot of room to earn points.  Quick feedback.  Personal interview in Spanish late in semester and is lenient.  Seems to really care for students.",
            "Dr. Stern is what his name implies, he doesn't like childish behavior but really enjoys the material. He expects you to read before but if you just skim and have good memorizing techniques you'll be able to get an A. I got a B+ in FLS 110 and an A in here. Much simpler and Stern's dry humor is a knee slapper. (ps dont take out your phone senores!)",
            "I placed into this class as a Freshman, and I was not expecting the course to be so difficult. There are quizzes nearly everyday, and you have to know your stuff in order to pass. I thought I was fairly well at Spanish, but now I am reconsidering. The tests are easy, but if you're looking for an easy A, look the other way.",
            "Never met a more difficult professor, or difficult person in general. He knows his Spanish well, but if you for any reason need to interact with him outside of that, he is frustrating.

Meeting this standard it relatively easy if you read the instructions and take good notes.",

The format of this class was changed, and it is now taught with all satisfactory/unsatisfactory grading, which if fine, but attendance is a big part of your grade. The only way to get an A+ is to do extra assignments that aren't part of your grade plus you can only have 1 unexcused absence.",
            "Ive had Dr. Binder for 2 classes now, and I would totally take another one! He teaches mostly 8 wk classes and I think that is what accounts for the work being harder. If you cant keep up with a fast paced class dont take an 8 week class with him. Otherwise 10/10 professor. Attendance on Top Hat, if your absent have someone text you the code.",
            "Dr. Binder is a great professor. Definitely cared about students. As long as you participated in weekly online assignments you could do well. Midterm and final were very easy. Other grading was never harsh and he was very willing to accommodate anything reasonable. Definitely take one of his courses if you have the chance.",
            "Dr. Binder is very friendly and tried to make lectures kind of interesting, but sometimes they were just so long and boring it was hard to focus. He uses a grade contract, so unless you really think you can't keep up with theH work, it should be an easy A. Dr. Binder as well as the TA's were quite kind graders, which also helped.",
            "Dr. Binder is the best! He is so kind and very open about his mental health which made me feel heard and he makes sure we know that he cares about our well being. Your grade relies on a grade contract where if you get above a 70% on tests, projects, and HW, you get an A in the class! Take him if you can!!",

            "Dr. Binder's class is centered around a grade contract that you sign in the first week. While it is a nuanced take towards class structure, it shows exactly what you have to do to achieve a certain grade. Overall, the class is pretty straightforward. The workload is reasonable and is graded fairly. It is clear that Dr. Binder wants you to succeed.",
            "Dr. Binder made his lectures interesting and funny. I learned a lot in this class. He has a unique grading system called a grade contract, which I liked because it made all the expectations very clear. It shows you EXACTLY what you need to do to get an A. Group projects were probably the hardest part, but if you plan out the work well it's not bad.",
            "I think Professor Binder was great, I enjoyed his lectures because he made the content interesting. He did grade using a grade contract which was interesting and honestly I would have rather not have had that, but thats my only complaint. Everything else was great. If you apply yourself and put in the work you can easily get an A in the class.",
            "For being an entry level comm. class, I thought this was quite work heavy. Lot's of videos to watch, a review sheet due the end of each week and sometimes discussion posts- as well as group projects. The tests seem intimidating but USE THE QUIZLETS HE MAKES! If you do the work and keep up, you'll be fine. Teaching wise he was really spectacular!",
            "Great teacher, he uses real-life examples to explain things which helps a lot. He uses \"Contract grading\" which is a little odd if you've never heard of it but It makes it almost impossible to do poorly in the class. Follow instructions and pay attention in class and you'll do fine. Tests are pretty detailed so studying is a must.",
            "I can't even put into words what an awesome professor Dr. Binder is. Not only is he so kind and understanding, but he took an anon survey from the class for what HE COULD DO BETTER to help us. He then announced everything he would change in the course to help us. I have never had a professor do anything close to that. So helpful with COVID stress!",
            "Great professor, would recommend taking a class with him. Wish he would've taught the material from the end of the semester more in depth because that's all the final project and exam are on. Do all the work and the class is an easy A.",
            "Professor Binder's class may seem a bit intimidating at first, but his lectures make everything simple and understandable. A lot of the assignments are pretty straightforward and the instructions are laid out pretty concisely. The tests can be hard because they are application based, but it isn't too hard to get a good grade in this class.",
            "Very clear in what he expects from you. Doing well in the course is easy as long as you keep up with assignments. It is reading/ writing heavy, but nothing unbearable.",
            "Dr. Binder makes this class so much harder than he needs to. The final project is absurdly difficult and time consuming but he still gives a final exam as well. The level of detail he expects in the research project is similar to what grad students do, which isn't fair to undergrad students. If you can, take this class with another professor.",
            "He expected us to attend every class session and be there for the ENTIRE time. The quizzes were very hard because you had to read the textbook. On homework assignments, he gave us too much feedback and let us rewrite them ... I just didn't bother! When I asked a question, he would actually listen and make us come up with answers. Too much thinking.",

He is a total introvert but he tries really hard to make the class more understandable. Great professor, imo.",
            "Nice guy but terrible teacher. makes you feel dumb for asking questions. Material is heavy and very hard. Whole class was confused and he does not help when meeting in office hours.

If you're coming into this with some understanding of economics then you can relax for pretty much the whole semester.

Best exams I've ever had, you had 24 hours to complete them and could use any notes or the lecture. He was a great prof and did his best to help everyone. The material was simple and easy to understand. I would recommend him.",

His lectures were straightforward, and he gave lots of real-world examples to illustrate his point. Homework was simple and the test format was fantastic (24hr window to complete and submit).",
            "Professor Massari is a very good choice for EC205. He is very passionate about Econ, so his lectures are done well (and are reflected well in his tests that you get 24 hours to do with your notes), and can be interesting even for an 8:30. He has optional homework assignments, practice exams, and an extra credit assignment for practice. Solid choice",
            "Signing up for Mr Massari's class was the best decision I could have made. He made EC 205, which could have been a major hassle, into a dream. His class was small enough to be able to work through individual questions and comments; he did not over complicate anything; he pointed out possible pitfalls in the material. He wasn't exactly fun though",

Homework assignments are optional and if you decide to do them, he only counts ones that improve your grade. He's also pretty funny. texts optional. Would def take him.",

I chose to only take the test and got a 95 and 96, respectively. He is very knowledgable and is happy to explain a concept with a different example to aid in understanding. Highly recommend taking him if you can.",

Easily accessible outside of class, and makes his lectures very engaging by talking with the students and cracking dry-humor jokes. Grades are very fair and provides lots of extra credit opportunities, and can really help your grade if you chose to do so.",
            "He's very knowledgeable in the material explains it the best he can. He's responded to my emails fairly quickly and been flexible with office hours. Has always provided clear examples and definitions during lecture. My only \"complaint\" is he doesn't like giving A+ without going above and beyond. Other than that, it's easy to get an A- or A.",

There's a good amount of homeworks and his tests can be pretty hard because of their length and specificity. He isn't particularly entertaining, but his lectures are generally good and I enjoy his class.",

            "He's an amazing professor and knows what he's talking about. He's super nice, but his tests are ridiculous. It's all short answer and memorizing things doesn't help you at all, so you actually have to understand things which is close to impossible.",
            "I would highly recommend Massari for EC205. He tries to help students succeed by making extra office hours before exams and dedicating a class to review material before exams. He encourages questions and gives practice tests and homework that are representative of test material. Real life examples are given and help to solidify understanding",
            "Massari uses humor and real-life examples to keep students engaged. He offers numerous opportunities to succeed and makes himself available outside of class.

I'll admit it is lecture oriented, so you should probably go to class, as well as pay attention and take notes. He also gives A LOT of makeup opportunities, so there really is no excuse for doing poorly in this class."

            "Never actually interacted with the professor. He has good lectures that are genuinely interesting and he has cool topics he goes over. There's 4 or 5 tests that are online and open note and an extra credit opportunity.",
            "Dr. Craig is a wonderful lecturer, and the online version of this class is, quite simply, the easiest 300-level class you will ever take. Final grade is 4 tests. All of them are 50 questions, 45 minutes, open-book. To get an A, print the slides that are provided and take copious notes while watching the recorded lectures.",
            "This was an easy class to take online, very simple outline and graded by four tests unless you choose to take the optional fifth at the end. Was very helpful for me as I had a heavy course load, definitely a back burner class. Subject matter was super interesting and I learned a lot.",
            "If you can take Professor Craig in person, you should. I had him online and he was very kind when we had the optional Zoom meetings. I would've loved to hear his lectures in person and have it be a little bit more interactive, but I don't have much else to complain about.",
            "There are 5 test that determine your grade, only 4 are required. He will drop the lowest test grade. I was online so he let us have open note test, I still recommend studying if you aren't good at looking up answers. He is nice, but it's all lectures.",
            "Dr. Craig was perfect. Knowledgeable about the content, concise & easy to understand, and has very reasonable expectations. Don't buy the book bc he goes over the same stuff in the lectures. Lots of chances for extra credit. The whole class was just 4 tests, an optional 5th test, & an optional paper to boost your grade. Would take him any day.",
            "Dr Craig is a very caring professor and he makes learning psychology fun. His lectures provide great examples of the things learned about in class and he explains them in an easy to understand way. Every test has built in extra credit so the class is an easy A as long as you simply show up to class and pay attention.",
            "Pay attention to lectures and youll be fine. Nice professor.",
            "Dr. Craig truly cares about his students and was more than willing to stop and explain any and all questions the class had. The lectures were all recorded and attendance was not required. No homework outside of class and topics are interesting. Only grades in this class are test scores, which aren't too difficult to score high on.",
            "He's a pretty good professor overall. Not too bad, not too boring, and the class itself is fairly easy. Just show-up, take notes, read the book a bit, and you should be fine.",
            "This class was a breeze. He can be funny sometimes, and boring some other times. Overall, a real chill dude. His tests were super easy if you read the book, he gives 5 extra questions on each tests(55 questions total on every test). The final was optional, so I only took 4 tests and got an easy A. He doesn't give any homework which is a plus",
            "The assigned seats in a 200+ person lecture that Dr. Craig implements is kind of insane. I dreaded coming to class for this reason and because he is a pretty boring lecturer.",
            "Dr. Craig was a good lecturer. The class itself was easy to pass as long as you take good notes and read the textbook. The first test I didn't do any ready and took mediocre notes and got a C. After that I paid attention and did the reading and got nothing but A's on the rest of the exams. He gives you plenty opportunities for extra credit to get A",
            "Good Professor. Like other people have pointed out, the class can get boring but he still does a good job.",
            "This course (with any other instructor) requires reading the textbook. However, Craig, clearly explains everything in his lectures, and unlike other professors, he does not assign homework at all, no assignmentspapers, and has 4-5 tests throughout the semester. His tests include 5 bonus questions and they are very fair. The final exam is optional.",
            "Craig's class wasn't bad, but I fell asleep often. Tests aren't bad but make sure to study. He offers five extra credit questions on each test so he grades out of 50 but has 55 questions.",
            "Bart's class is wonderful and I thoroughly enjoyed his class discussions. His tests are very fair, READ the textbook because he does test you on it even though you won't cover it in class. Also make use of the book's companion site for studying and he takes questions directly offline so its obvious if you try. He offers a few EC opportunities too.",
            "This is a great professor and made psych fun and interesting.  The class was also designed very fairly so that it was easy to make an A if you follow instructions and read through the text.  Very fun class.",
            "His class was very informative about psychology and I learned a lot! I realized I love psychology, so I added psychology as a second major because of this class. Dr. Craig is great and a very fair and generous professor. Take him!",
            "I highly suggest you take this professor for PSY 200--he is amazing!! He makes the class interesting; if you aren't lazy and read the textbook you will deff make an A in this class. I read every assigned chapter and ended up with an 99 in the class :)"

If you don't put exactly what she's looking for on tests, you won't do well. but she gives test questions a week before to prepare",
            "Professor Cunningham is a really good professor, but you have to be ready to read, pay attention, and ask questions. This is a HARD class if you don't take notes or read. I would have loved to not have lecture everyday though. It can make it hard for people with different learning styles. I did find myself losing focus a lot.",
            "Thought this was going to be a fun class but boy was I wrong. So difficult and she talks the whole class with no breaks and her lectures are disorganized. I haven't learned much at all. She also doesn't allow technology during class which is strange. It's 2022?? Exams are way harder than the things she lectures on. Definitely don't recommend it!",
            "DO NOT take this class. Professor is very nice but teaches like it is 1950. No notes online, no class recording, not even any visuals in class. All she does is talk about what is in the textbook you have to read",
            "Dr. Cunningham is very nice but is very difficult. Your only grades are 3 exams and a final so there is not much room for error. She only lectures and it can get very boring. The material is fine but the lectures are very easy to disengage with. There is a lot of information thrown at you and the exams are not easy.",
            "The most boring class I have ever taken.  It is primarily based on a set list of readings she has you read and then all you do in lecture is look at her notes.  If you don't know a lot of religious history, I would not recommend.  The essay's are a lot harder then anything she tells you and you don't actually learn anything.",
            "75 min of straight lecture every single class, no breaks, no PowerPoints- just her talking and writing on the whiteboard. Not allowed to use technology for notes, so when she doubles back on a repetitive topic (happens often) your paper notes get super disorganized. She is a sweet and understanding person/professor, but this class was awful.",
            "Best professor I had this semester",
            "She enjoys what she is teaching and does a good job of explaining the material in lectures. I have fallen asleep listening to her videos a few times, but that's only because she has one of those voices and not because the material is boring. The 4 essays (25% each) were pretty extensive but easy if you used the resources she gave you.",
            "Dr. Cunningham is an extremely intelligent professor. I took the class online and it was perfect for that format. Her lectures are very dense and there is A LOT of reading! I learned a lot from the course. There were three essays (30% each) and I was terrified at first but I achieved very high scores on all of them by reading and paying attention!",
            "Grade is 90% three essays. She wrote the textbook; you basically read the entire thing by the end of the semester. I find religion difficult to understand, but the textbook is as clear as it can be. If you aren't willing to read weekly, don't take this class. Her lectures are dense and fast, but helpful. She's accessible/kind/ gives great feedback.",
            "Cunningham lectured the entire time. It was extremely hard not to get bored listening. Her exams are based off of the study guides but make sure your essays are extremely thorough and spot on (tough grades for those). Her handwriting looked like chicken scratch most days and she never stopped talking to engage us. Not a bad class, just very boring.",
            "Dr. Cunningham is a very kind person and seems to care a lot about what she teaches. She is super smart and I enjoyed listening to her lectures, but sometimes the lectures would get repetitive and boring. She made sure to cover all sides of the controversial topics. If you like writing you will like this class.",
            "Professor Cunningham is a very sweet lady! Her classes are very lecture heavy and you will have some papers. We had 4 essays in total and then some short one page papers for homework every once in a while. In general, the class isn't too hard if you just copy down the notes and look back through them as you are writing your essays.",
            "Easy ish class if you really do the readings since the 3 papers are based on the readings. Her lectures are long and no visuals. Her handwriting sucks so it is sometimes hard to read the board, comments on paper, etc.",
            "Professor Cunningham provided an interesting experience. She's very caring but has a specific teaching method. Her lectures are non-stop and you'll be receiving a lot of information in one class. However, her tests are literally made from the study guides, so as long as you really study ahead of the exam, you should do fine. I enjoyed her class.",
            "The teacher herself was good, however, all I have learned is about Christianity, Judaism, and some Islam. I expected other religions such as Hinduism as well, but from what has been lectured, it is mainly Christianity. The course name itself feels misleading as I felt it should have just been named Christianity in the Contemporary World.",
            "You have to come to class or you'll fail, she writes notes on the white board for everyone to take down and then she erases them and they're gone. The only grades are the 4 tests, all weighted the same. Just study your notes well and you'll pass, the study guides are great help. Don't have to read textbook or selections, they just help you study.",
            "Loved Dr. Cunningham. You do have to read but as an engineering major I kind of liked the reading. There are ABSOLUTELY NO surprises on tests but you do need to study and she posts study guides to fill out. She will even look at your study guide and tell you where to brush up before a test. Take her class",
            "This class did not require much work other than a midterm, essay based, and a take home final paper (12-15pg). If you want to pass you have to read the textbook, I promise I read about 75% of the book and it is not passable if you don't. I wouldn't take the class if you expect an easy A"

Occasionally he would display something on the overhead, but other than that he is not tech savvy. He prefers his students not to take notes using their laptops. Bring a decent notebook and colored pens to class because he loves to draw graphs.",
            "He is really nice, but not at first. His lectures can get dry and he can go too fast and speak too soft. However if you take good notes and make a study group you do fine. The tests are made up of half of the homework. So you will at least get 50%. Only one homework sheet and one exam per unit. If you need help he is really good about giving it.",
            "His class is very straight forward. The homework assignments are the tests. Keep up with the reading and you'll be fine. But nothing is on moodle or online so you have to actually go. Sweet guy but he will never let you out early. Other than that he is easy.",

If you do the homework, and pay attention, you are almost guaranteed to pass. He's very willing to help any student that shows up to class and pays attention. Highly recommend.",

            "He is a bad teacher.  You must write everything he says down because he's too lazy to use the board to organize his thoughts.  This means you have no chance to think about what he's saying in class.  So you go home with words and no meaning.  If you want a class where you think about the issues and discuss concepts this isn't it.",

He gives time consuming homework; however, if you put the effort into doing them correctly his tests will be extremely easy.  All tests are short answer.",

Take a lot of notes during his class and pay attention to what he says. He will not write everything down on the board for you so actually write down what he instructs.",

He does not let you enter until he puts a certain black bag away... I also see him at the gym slamming weights and arguing with people for machines. One instance turned PHYSICAL.",
            "Why...just why. His rudeness makes me sick on my stomach. I also quit going to his class whenever I realized he was just lecturing STRAIGHT from the book. Took him fall 2023 and I still think about how awful it was. Anyone who enjoyed him is lying. Avoid at all cost.",
            "If you told me this class was a social experiment taught by some random dude they found on the street I would honestly believe you. Ulker gets confused, flustered, and annoyed frequently and likes to send email rants in the middle of the night. Tests are graded very harshly and don't reflect the class.  Dropped a nice curve tho",
            "The most harsh, disrespectful, and uneducated teacher I have ever had during my time at NCSU. He grades extremely harshly, talks down to you, and gaslights you into thinking you're the problem. I cannot believe all he put the class through. He will fail the entire class. I noticed he is not teaching the course next semester, I wonder why?",
            "Definitely the worst professor I've ever taken. Ulker grades exams very harshly. Any small mistake on one of the 30 pt problems INCLUDING typing into a calculator wrong will land you with just 5/30 pts. Especially for C-walled class, this guy's standards are way too high. Save yourself if you can, he is not afraid to fail everyone.",

Additionally Ulker is extremely hard to get a hold of via email and when he does respond it is always late. when I met with him he was extremely inconsiderate.",

From what I've heard, he's much better than dr. tu for dynamics.",

Ulker would say he doesn't know the answer or make up and mislead students. I only got a good grade because my father used to teach the class. AVOID!",

Grade dist was one of the worst in years. No amount of studying, office hours, or extra help will improve your grade, he simply grades you on poorly worded, never-before-seen test problems.",

It was very common for him to say \"I don't know\" or \"Would someone find the answer to that\" to a students question. He would also send out massive RANT emails degrading students and complaining about his job. VERY unprofessional.",

He treated students like peasants and got into a physical altercation with a student. The entire class was going to fail until he hit us with a curve. I hate him.",

HORRIBLE LECTURES, MAYBE 15 kids showed up each day after the first lecture. He was so bad a large group of students went to the department head to try and get him fired. Straight up embarrassing for NC State's engineering program.",

I did not feel respected, and I often left the class with more questions than answers due to myriad inaccuracies in the lecture material. I tried giving Dr. Ulker the benefit of the doubt, but I eventually couldn't defend him any longer. I would advise not learning under him if possible.",

He thought we were too soft and it was his job to fix",

No resources on Moodle; if you miss class you get screwed over. The 'class' is just going over homework (he calls on you for answers at random). Nuh uh",
            "Class was spent going over the homework, which we had to write it all down, and he would call on us for answers. I experienced more stress due to his class than any other, more so than my major classes. My spanish improved a lot though, along with my note taking and study skills. Very sweet and caring. Recommend if you want to be fluent.",
            "Professor Villa-Garcia had good intent. However, he had a hard time understanding us and was very unclear on what homework would be assigned, and we had to wait until the end of a class before knowing what was due at the beginning of the next. Computers were allowed. He would pick students to answer questions at random; there was no volunteering.",
            "I really enjoyed having Professor Leonardo Villa-Garcia as a teacher. I learned a lot more in this class than I did in FLS 110. I would recommend taking the hour and fifteen minute class if you have a hard time teaching yourself material from fifty-minute classes.",
            "He is super chill!! The classes are pretty straight forward and the curriculum is consistent and predictable. He gives test format guides before each test and prepares you really well!! Super chill hombre.",
            "I have a chronic illness that causes me to throw up, pass out, etc. Understandably, I would miss class. I have provided documentation of my condition and sent him numerous emails to which he has failed to respond. I have had to call the Spanish department and contact other professors because he is unable to do his job. Get it together.",
            "Very unorganized. Gives important papers and assignments the class right before the test so there isn't much time to work on it. Don't plan on being able to sleep while taking this class. The study guide is the only redeeming quality of this class, it's kind of helpful. Mindtap is the worst. Way too much work for the class level/time.",
            "Speaks mostly Spanish, which is good for practice but bad for lecturing. Doesn't really explain anything. Hard to understand. Just goes over assignments in class. A ton of homework, and a test every 3-4 class periods (if you take it two days a week). I do not recommend taking his class.",
            "If you show up and know the answers to the homework, participation is taken care of. Just do the work and study a little bit and you will succeed. Didnt get lower than a 97 on any test. Leo is an older guy with a lot of experience. Respect him and he will respect you. He (as with most FL profs) doesnt use Moodle, so check in with him regularly.",
            "Very sweet professor, but not equipped to teach a college course. Directions for assignments were often unclear and the class as a whole was very disorganized. He talks in Spanish the whole class which is great, but may be difficult for some students at this level. Tests cover a lot of material, so be sure to look at textbook exercises!",
            "Avoid. Although he is nice, he has a thick accent and is hard to communicate with. The class is laughably confusing at times. There are so many questions you won't get clear answers to. No Moodle page either, literally no way to check your grade. Very little educational value in going to class, we just go over homework. pick his wife over him.",
            "such a sweet man. you will struggle in this class if you don't know Spanish though. his Spanish accent when he speaks English is very heavy, but as an intermediate Spanish teacher he shouldn't be speaking English anyways. he really cares for his students and just wants you to succeed. he brightens up my day every time I go to his class!!!!",
            "He never answered any emails and I sent him six. He always says he will email us information but never does. He doesn't stick to the syllabus and start asking you for answers for exercises that weren't supposed to be finished until the next class. There wasn't anything good about this professor except that I have been getting good grades.",
            "Prof Garcia is a very sweet man and cares about teaching Spanish. It seems like the only people struggling in the class are those who didn't have a sufficient level of understanding from previous Spanish classes.",
            "Too much homework for a 200 level class. The tests are very hard being that you have to write sentences. Teaching yourself is mandatory. Best option.. take another teacher unless you are an upper level Spanish student or are intending on minoring in Spanish.",
            "Literally never did homework and just BS'd the class because I'd already done AP Spanish. Didn't learn very much in this class",
            "The way Prof. Villa-Garcia teaches can be pretty confusing to figure out what he wants and when it's due. You \"learn\" by doing all the work at home and reviewing it in class. Participation points are big and if you look him in the eyes when he's reviewing work, he WILL call on you, so if you don't know the answer, do not look up.",
            "I loved him. He did call on you during class, and you had to do your homework, but I thought he really cared about his job and he cared about his students.",
            "He is a nice guy who really wants you to understand the concepts. He forces you to participate. Impossible to reach by email and was often not in his office during office hours so don't expect a any contact out of the classroom. The material is very similar to 201- so if you did well int that you will be fine.",
            "I took FLS 201 with him and it was super easy. As long as you participate and do the book work on the syllabus most of the time you will be fine. His tests are not difficult and he is an easy grader and I'm pretty sure he curves the tests. His accent can be difficult to understand at times, but it is not a big deal."

Easy A, tests are online and open note (not to mention look VERY SIMILAR to the study guide she gives you), and there are 5 free absences. No prior dance experience is needed, she makes the class a safe space to dance",
            "Take Macy. Yes, she is pretty easy if you go to class, but she is also SO nice. Workouts are pretty moderate, especially if you workout. Starts 5 minutes after class starts, and always ends at least 5 minutes early. 2 tests open note (exactly the practice questions). Practical is only form (no fitness tests!!). I would wait just to take her.",
            "She is the best gym teacher. Her tests are not hard and as long as you do the few assignments and go to class then you will get a A+.",
            "Made everything super easy to understand and genuinely wanted you to have fun. Wish I could take this class again!",
            "Macy was literally the best HESF instructor ever! I had here for water aerobics and she gave us 5 absences, only had one physical test (it was literally 3 minutes long and so easy), and she is so kind! She always started and ended class at least 5 minutes early. 100% take her!",
            "This was the easiest HESF ever. She is so nice. She gives you the answers to the test, makes it online, open note, open internet. She give you 5 free absences so I literally didn't go the entire last month. Very easy workouts, kind of fun, not stressful.",
            "I took the asynchronous online version of Aerobics, and it was incredibly easy! She gives lots of time to do assignments and is a very reasonable grader. Put an ounce of effort in and you'll get an A, especially if it's online!",
            "She is so nice. You should get an A+ if you just go to all the classes and do all the assignments. The two written exam are online and you can use the slides which literally are the questions with the answers one by one. There is one practical exam which is also not demanding at all. She is very caring and super understanding with absences and late",
            "Professor Kalb was the sweetest woman I have ever met. I took social dance with her. There was no homework, and she pretty much gives you the answers to all the written tests. She was very receptive to students and was always trying to lighten their workload. Go to class and learn the dances and you'll pass with flying colors!",
            "Macy has been my favorite instructor this semester. The class is set up like a Zumba class and has made me feel so much more comfortable working out with other people in the room. Provided modifications to any workout and grades on correct form rather than repetition which shows students how to truly work out without pushing too hard.",
            "macy kalb is the best! her workouts are so fun and balanced throughout the semester. if you look at the powerpoints for maybe 5 minutes for the exams, you're set.",
            "Macy Kalb was one of my favorite professors at State. She is caring and offers modifications to some of the exercises so everyone can do them. A few tests and assignments but all are super easy and she provides quizlets to look over before the tests.",
            "Macy is by far one of my favorite professors at NC State. Her classes were always super fun & easy. She always gives modifications for exercises that not everyone can do and always plays fun music to keep everyone energized. All the tests are super easy and she posts quizlets to help you prepare!",
            "Macy is great. She is very nice and always excited for class. A few tests and homework were super easy the class was fun she plays good music and also responds to emails quick. I would recommend this class with her! Very easy A.",
            "Awesome professor! Take her!",
            "Coach Kalb, is a super sweet person. I really loved the Pilates class that I took for her class. I would highly recommend her",
            "She's the best!!! So sweet and understanding! Pilates was so much fun with her! 100/10 recommend!!!",
            "Professor Kalb is so kind and understanding! I took water aerobics with her and she made it very fun and was also considerate with time; usually ending a bit early so we can change into clothes in case you had a class right after. No final and only 2 exams to which she posted all the answers on moodle. I would definitely take her again!",
            "Very easy class and would recommend as first option to take if needing a required gym class. She understands it is a 1 credit course and treats it as so, so no hws or worries outside the class. Only one very mild small group project and super easy. 2 exams as well which she makes easy. Music working out is fun & way too easy to pass up, take her!!",
            "super kind and understanding. being on time and dressed appropriately is very important for this class"

            "Though I despise DE and only took this because it's a prereq, got through with sanity intact :) Very well organized, 4-5 short multi-choice quizzes/week + three 1k-word papers. had supplemental crashcourse videos but no recorded lectures. Only got graded on my first paper, but also didn't ask about the others, so that mighta been a system error",
            "The course isn't difficult and Stiffler and the TA were pretty responsive when I emailed them. The problem I had is that when they release essay grades, they don't tell you what you could improve and only tell you vaguely which questions you lost points on. Other than that, the course content was interesting and this is a good professor.",
            "Each week you have a homework assignment that you can keep trying until you get a 100. These, paired with the occasional discussion forums (more like essays) and final family portfolio project make up your grade. Super easy class if you just stay on top of the deadlines.",
            "This course was very easy. There were quizzes assigned for each chapter in the textbook that you could do until you got a 100. There were four discussion post throughout the semester based on the textbook. The final project takes very little time to complete.",
            "I liked her as a professor, and I'd recommend the class. it was pretty easy, consisted of weekly inquizitives which let you keep going until you get a 100%, four essay forum posts, and a final project. only negative are the forums (discussion posts), they're long essays (at least 1000 words) about questions from the text book",
            "Dr. Stiffler is a very kind woman and deeply cares about her students. The only downfall I experienced with this class was the amount of reading required; we were scheduled to read 4 total books for this class but she ended up dropping one of them due to time constraints. If you aren't a fan of reading, I would think twice before taking this class.",
            "Dr. Stiffler is very nice. I had another class with her in the past and enjoyed them a lot. However, as some of the other reviews have noted, she is EXTREMELY flakey. She did not have a syllabus until the third week of class, and after telling us which books to order, added another and assigned readings and discussions before anyone could get it.",
            "Very chill professor - sweet and lenient. Fair grader. Class is easy - 3 assignments, a final project and a weekly inquizitive. Highly recommend for this class.",
            "Great Class! Dr. Stiffler makes her class enjoyable and easy to succeed in. There's weekly inquizitives, 3 essays, and a final project. Do all your work and you'll get an A.",
            "Dr. Stiffler is amazing! Its so easy to tell that shes a caring person. This class was definitely easy in terms of work load. She doesnt grade critically and cares more that you thoroughly understand the content. She responds very quickly and is really understanding. Basically just three essays and a final project, but are very straightforward!",
            "I see mixed reviews on here but I will clarify - if you need to take SOC300 as many do, DEFINITELY take it with Dr. Stiffler. Her classroom is a great environment, you are guaranteed to pass with what you need to know. Only down side is a weekly online quiz of the textbook, though I found them quite easy and rarely got below a 90.",
            "Forums due every week which were very annoying b/c they are whole essays. Weekly quizzes were easy and a final project. As long as you do the work you'll pass but it's easy to slack off on an online class.",
            "Quiz heavy (count for 50% of your grade). The forum posts are kind of annoying. Over not too bad. However, I did miss one quiz do to external circumstance and the professor wasn't really accommodating.",
            "I took this class online. There isn't a whole lot of busy work so if you need a social science credit, take this class! Weekly quizzes and a discussion question every other week. And there's a project at the end of the semester. Highly recommend. Would take her class every semester if I could.",
            "An amazing professor, you won't fail but you can learn.",
            "Take this class! She is a great professor and is very engaging. This is an easy and interesting social science GEP. You only have 13 open note quizzes, a final project, and some in class assignments. No tests, papers, midterm or final, but she does take attendance! The book is helpful when taking quizzes, but most of the questions are on quizlet!",
            "Dr. Stiffler is really nice in person & very helpful if you are having a hard time understanding something. GO TO THE LABS. She shows you how to do it step by step & the info becomes easy to understand as she walks you through it. There is a final paper due that ends up being around 20 pages but the labs you do give you all the info. Easy quizzes.",
            "Dr. Stiffler creates a great learning environment when we have class. She canceled more classes than she held so the class was mostly online. Class is an easy A if you keep up with quizzes and activities. She preached about email etiquette but is rude in her emails and does not respond to questions. I enjoyed the topic but not so much the professor",
            "I took her online during the summer and tip, if you are anywhere close to campus GO TO LAB, she pretty much walks you through everything and I receive an A on almost every lab assignment because I was able to get confirmation and guidance. Read Textbook, made the mistake to wing it on online quiz and didn't really do well. She is very helpful!",
            "Dr. Stiffler gives clear and enjoyable lectures. She creates a safe and fun environment for students to share their opinions on all topics and teaches the class in a way that you leave with a new and more developed thought process.

I improved my swing a lot for irons, but don't be upset if the shot isn't always straight. Wish we could have done something with drivers, but you can fool with them at the practice range. $25 cost.",
            "Chances are, if you're looking at his page for this class, you have some prior running experience. I would highly recommend him for this class. Final tests were easy (sub 23 5k, sub 7 mile, 2 minute plank, 30 pushups in one minute for a 100). Any day we had a quiz, lecture, or assignment due, there was no class. There are some textbook quizzes.",

I took this pass/fail but I ended up getting an A- because he gives you lots of chances to make a good grade. GREAT professor! You will 100% enjoy his class (:",
            "If you are even the slightest ok at golf, this class will be easy as pass fail. Most of the exams have to do with certain aspects of golf (putting, chipping, etc.) and are easy to at least get a passing grade. My ability to play golf even increased from the class.",
            "One of the best professors Ive ever had. I was really worried about the PE class, however he makes cycling amazing and fun. Great music too! Cares about his students and will talk to us about anything; great guy and super easy to like.",

            "I really loved Coach DeReu. He makes you run a lot which was the worst part of the class because I absolutely hate running. He knows what he is talking about and is very encouraging. He knows we are all not body builders. I really  would recommend him.",
            "Really great professor. You can tell he genuinely cares about his students and their well-being, not just their grades in his class. He understands that the class is really hard to pass, so if you just show up and try your best, he'll make sure you pass. Take it pass/fail unless you're an experienced archer!!",
            "If you come to class and put in the work you will pass. You need the textbook for the online quizzes. If you hate running this may be a class to avoid. If you do a 5k during the semester he will give you extra credit.",
            "Coach DeReu was clear in his expectations afor the class.  Students run for set amounts of time each day, increasing by 2 minutes for each \"lecture,\" ending at around 26 minutes or so by the end of the semester.  Also have 3 quizzes on material from a textbook, but they were so easy that I took all of them the first weekend and did well.",

Throughout the course of the class I got super good at bowling, and you can skip the class 5 times with no penalty. Seriously the best class you can take at NC State."

            "This class is very hard. Dr. Bullard was a great professor, but the class was insanely hard.",
            "CHE 205 is already a difficult class, but Dr. Bullard made it so much more bearable. Her lectures were the best of any of the professors and she was clearly passionate about the course. Would highly recommend not only taking her class but establishing a relationship with her!",
            "Shes very passionate. CHE395 consisted of attendance and 3 big assignments.",
            "She chose a class time of 4:30 pm - 5:45 pm because she reserved a room last-minute, made attendance for every lecture (which was just industry/grad school reps. advertising for a program or giving abstract career advice) mandatory, and penalized us for not filling out a survey after never mentioning that this survey would be part of any grade.",
            "I love Dr. Bullard! She was great, but the setup... not so much. Personally, I don't do well with the guided notes being so split up and only given conceptual examples in class, but I survived and I am sure you will too if you take Dr. Bullard.",
            "If your advisor is AWOL, she'll help. Very responsive outside of class. She learns everyone's names within a week and will cold (or hot) call on you. Class is very straightforward, and a TON of effort was clearly put into how the class is setup. Tests get graded scarily fast. She genuinely wants you to succeed just put in the work and don't cheat!",

She's so nice and caring and very clear with her expectations and material. however, I noticed for writing assignments like CHE395, she can be a harsh grader but provides feedback. so if your writing isn't good and wants to get an A, stay away. otherwise, she's a wonderful teacher and very caring.",

If you're struggling and ask for help she will do anything she can to help you succeed. 205 is a difficult course, but if you pay attention in lectures and do the homework you will pass.",
            "Lisa Bullard is an amazing person and an amazing professor. It's clear she cares about her students and her department, and really wantes everyone to succeed. It's a tough class, but if you pay attention, try hard on homework, and ask questions when needed, you'll do well.",
            "Lisa Bullard is a wonderful teacher, Some of the comments from below that don't have much legitimate criticism may be from a few events awhile back. The ChE Department caught students cheating and they were punished, the point being if you're going into ChE don't come in if you're going to cheat. Professor Bullard is a great teacher and adviser.",
            "Dr. Bullard is a fantastic professor. She explains material incredibly well and enthusiastically. There is a lot of homework, but there has to be in CHE courses. If you don't do the practice, you won't succeed. The heavy homework load makes it far easier to study for exams, as you won't really need to study too much.",
            "Had her for 1 class, but mainly as an adviser.  Had a bit of a chip on my shoulder while in college and felt like  no one was trying to help.  In hindsight Dr. Bullard made every effort to help me and every other student.  Wish I'd been more thankful at the time.  (this was 8-10 years ago)",
            "Lisa Bullard is like a mother to me. She is so caring for her students. The class is hard is hard as hell but if you do the work and DON'T CHEAT you'll do fine. Use her office hours.",
            "Hard and helpful. How I like it",
            "I loved Dr.Bullard! After a really bad test she personally talked to me about whether I wanted to stay or drop the course. When I wanted to stay she helped me to finish (with an A). Make sure your book is organized and passing is easy. Homework load is very heavy!!!",
            "She is an amazing teacher. She will do anything she can to help you as long as you show that you are truly trying. She keeps class entertaining so it's easy to stay awake (even at 8 am!)She is not easy, but if you're in Chemical Engineering and looking for easy you need to change majors.",
            "A great advisor, although not a great teacher. I don't understand how profs who are \"experts\" on engineering education are so terrible at teaching. Vague, hard grader, generally annoying as a person; however, this is CHE so you have to grin and bear it. Red bull and cigarettes will help."

            "Dr. Beckman is so helpful and really supports her students. While her class is a lot of work, she really makes sure you understand every concept. She provides many opportunities to use your French skills. If you do the work and go to class, Dr. Beckman can really help you improve your French.",
            "Unfortunately she's leaving the school soon to retire.  Such a shame!  I wish she could teach my every English or French class I have left to take!",
            "She is a good teacher and is enthusiastic about the class, but assigns WAY too much work. I mean an insane amount of homework. Every single night. She isn' a tough grader, but it was impossible for me to keep up with the assignments. If you have a tough schedule I would not recommend because you will end up spending all of your time on this class.",
            "I struggled for my A. I love French and cinema, but this was awful. Assigned far too much work. I didn't even crack open my book but once (and didn't bother to buy the other one) because it was worthless. A good class to take if you don't have a full course load, but expect to suffer. Corrects her corrections of her corrections--never satisfied.",
            "Madame Beckman is great! This class does have a lot of homework, but it isn't extremely difficult. If you ever have any problems with class or with life, Madame Beckman is always there to talk with you. She is an amazing teacher, and an even better person. If you have the opportunity to take her class, DO IT!",
            "Madame Beckman is an incredible French professor. She gives a lot of homework and outside assignments, but that's because she is teaching two semesters worth of material in one semester. Tests are easy and work is easy, and if you're having a hard time she is always excited and happy to help you out. Definitely take her if you can!",
            "Madame Beckman is such an amazing professor. She's by far my favorite professor I've had at NCSU. Yes there's a lot of reading, but she goes over it thoroughly in class. You also get a cheat sheet for the midterm and final. The projects are fun and  she lets you choose want you want to do. She's eccentric and funny. Definitely take this class!",
            "Yes you have to work for your grade, but the classes you work for, those are the classes that help you in your future endeavors!  I had this class my senior year and it was worth it!  Put in the hard work and you will get an A.  One of the most supportive, helpful, and knowledgeable professors I have had in my four years in college.  Take it!",
            "Dr. Beckman expects that all of her students try, but if you do try, you're almost guaranteed an A! Engaging, interesting, and excited about her subject.  I thoroughly enjoyed this class, and would immediately take more classes with her if I could. Two finals, a term paper, and some short assignments graded on completion.",
            "Do not take this class. The work is insane and unless you take a huge interest in the stuff she teaches, she won't like you. You must be a literary genius and don't even think about turning in something not worthy of her reading. Don't take this class if you don't already know a lot about literature.",
            "This class was interesting and Dr. Beckman was nice. However, she assigns an obnoxious amount of busy work. EVERY SINGLE NIGHT you will have at least 50-100 pages to read PLUS 2 pages of writing to turn in. Not an eco-friendly class or a time friendly class. The busy work literally took away from this class and all of my other classes . :/",
            "Dr. B is one of the most amazing literature teachers I have ever had. She really loves what she teaches, and makes it relevant to the class room, is engaging, and overall a fantastic  person. I would happily take many more courses with her.",
            "Falls into the \"exceptional\" category of instructors at this school. She went above and beyond in providing us students with the best possible knowledge of the material. I was surprised yet impressed by Diane Beckman and how she truly cares about students learning, and goes through all efforts possible to make that happen.",
            "She is honestly one of the best professors that I have had at State. She is super nice, her class is interesting and you will learn a lot. You do have homework every night, but just do the readings and you'll be fine. Seriously take this class!",
            "I love Dr.Beckman. She is so nice, and must love her job. She does assign homework every night, however, I know I turned in crap almost everyday and she would put smiley faces and checks all over it. She makes the class fun and definatly worth your while!",
            "While I got an A in the class, I must say Dr. Beckman is INSANE in relation to the amount of work assigned in this class.  Rather than study your \"important\" subjects- you will be forced at times to read 100+ pages to write an idiotic paper (you will write papers for every class).  Unless you have tons of free time, avoid this class and this prof.",
            "She's really quirky and LOVES what she is teaching. I thought it was a really easy class but I learned alot at the same time. As long as you try hard then you'll get a good grade. She likes those who participate!",
            "A lot of work (sometimes a little too much) but if you participate and are attentive to the overall plot of the readings, you will do fine.",
            "I went into the class loving French and left hating it. She's not a very good teacher. She'll help you but if she doesn't like you she'll make your life hell and treat you like scum. This class was not fun at all and I dreaded it and there is TONS of work.",
            "Great class.  lots of work, but if you do the work you will get an A.  Paper 2 was fun to write and I am a science major.  Take this class!"

            "He does have an accent, but he is still easy to understand. He records attendance every day and if you miss more than 5 classes you fail the course. He lectures every day and sometimes plays movies/ethnographic films. The tests are solely based on the textbook",
            "Raja isn't a bad professor, however, his lectures are extremely boring, and attendance is mandatory. All of the quizzes and tests are take home, so they're easy A's, but going to class was a waste of time.",
            "Not a bad guy. He takes attendance almost every class and the lectures are very boring and long. Small reading quiz due the day before almost every class but its all on quizlet. Tests were taken online at home and I found most of it on quizlet. Just can be painfully boring to go to.",
            "Worse lectures of my life, however the class overall is easy. You have 2 quizzes every week, and 2 exams (which are the quiz questions put in 1 exam format lol). He is lazy when it comes to marking, and decided we should do a final paper a week before exams ended. That being said, I did not learn anything but did get a good grade",
            "Professor Abillama is a chill guy and outlines his expectations for the class very clearly. He only gave 3 tests, but we also used inquisitive which helped. He does lecture most of class and usually reiterates the assigned readings, but he occasionally shows short documentaries and lets us work in groups during class to answer questions.",
            "Raja Abillama is a great professor, he truly knows what he is talking about. The only problem is that other than homework assignments and in-class discussions, there is not much else to be taught. To completely understand the material you will need to read the textbook - but if you don't care about the material it is completely easy to get a A+.",
            "It's not as bad as some are making it out to be. I don't know about ANT, but I had him for IS and it was fine. There isn't much work and the conversations (if you're in a good class) can be really interesting. Relatively easy A so take it or leave it.",
            "Not bad at all. Easy A because every single quiz and test is on Moodle. Basically, there's 2 quizzes every week that are 10 ?'s each & come straight from the textbook. Just buy the online textbook, & command F everything. There are two tests, both on Moodle. I got 100s on every quiz and test. Lectures can be boring. Take him if you want an easy A+",
            "Great guy! If you engage in the material, the class is interesting. You have 2 moodle quizzes a week but if you do the reading (which is always topical), you'll be fine. Take my man Raja!",
            "I was wary of taking this professor due to reviews, but Abillama is not bad at all! You know exactly what to expect each class-- readings + short quiz due and a lecture/discussion every class. Not the most exciting class structure, but he is understanding and you WILL ace the tests if you study and do the extensive study guides that are provided.",
            "Was really excited AT FIRST to learn about Cultural Anthropology. Shortly after starting his class I realized that it was going to be a HORRIBLE semester. The ONLY grades he gives are for reading quizzes which are very ambiguous and specific and his exams which are brutal. He also doesn't acknowledge opinions that aren't his own. DO NOT TAKE CLASS",
            "He lectures during the whole class. If you aren't actually going to read the readings don't take his class, lots of class participation and gets mad when only a few people answer his questions. Not very friendly, prefers his own opinions over anyone else's. 0/10 would recommend.",
            "He lectures 100% of the time, and every thing comes from power points that he posts, so going to class isn't necessary. He's not kind or merciful to students, once he got mad that we didn't come prepared to class with questions for review even though he hadn't posted the study guide, and then wasn't available at all  for meetings before the final.",
            "Nope. All boring lectures that he can't make interesting since his voice stays in one tone.  I know you might be thinking about maybe taking this course but please do yourself a favor and take something else. Prepare to sleep and hate this class if you take it.",
            "Soooooooo boring. Straight up monotone. Get ready to fall asleep:(",
            "I love Raja. He's a great professor, really funny and tries to keep the class engaged. Some of his questions are ambiguous , yes, but he's trying to improve that. Only real complaint is that he's soft spoken and has an accent so it can be difficult to follow him. But yes I do love him and he's a really nice understand guy!",
            "I have taken Raja for both IS200 and ANT252 so I have a lot experience with this professor. Raja is a cool professor, and he can be tough, sure. ANT252 with Raja was very easy, I would actually recommend it. IS200 requires ALOT of participation and reading, but it definitely isn't that hard if you do your work. He really isn't that bad, guys..",
            "The beginning of the semester with Raja was very rough, his lectures were long and the questions he asked extremely ambiguous. The first test was disastrous. However, Raja redeemed himself when he asked for feedback on how the class was going. We talked to him and he made some crucial changes in the way the grades and tests were scored.",
            "Raja treats material that is very open to interpretation as if there was only one answer.  Most questions can have multiple answers based off interpretations of the reading, however, he expects one specific answer with very specific wording other wise you'll get a zero for the question.  Overall he's unhelpful, unclear, and the worst prof I've had.",
            "Basically the tests suck and have super specific questions from the readings with several correct answers. You don't really need to take notes or read because he gives you summaries and vocab at the end to look at. Also, he's kind of difficult to understand; he has an accent and is very soft spoken.  I would not take him again."

She takes students' input on the types of questions for exams and is keen on trying out new methods of teaching and listening to students' opinions. Not sure why some of the reviews are not the best.",
            "Really nice professor, but she does speak somewhat slowly.",
            "Not too challenging if you keep up with lectures, take notes, and master calculator commands. Plenty of lectures to breeze through at 1.5-2x speed, and Professor Danaher's explanations make understanding the content straightforward.",
            "Great professor! She is very respectful to her students, helpful, and clear. I did miss one day of class and that was when we learned about ANOVAs and that was not fun. Don't miss a class. I know if I attended that it would've been easy to pick up. Don't be afraid to ask questions either because she will give a respectful and helpful response",
            "Very nice professor that cares about learning your name. Also she guides you through most of the homework and labs in class if you ask. Attending class isn't mandatory so I missed a few and still did wonderful. If you do attend class all she does is read off PowerPoints which can get boring. The review sessions are what I found the most helpful.",
            "An okay professor. Nothing against her, but she talks really slow. If you have to take her, take online to 2x speed lectures. HW's and quizzes posted weekly. Keep up with the announcements or you will miss them. 3 labs, 1 dropped. 1 optional final project. 1st exam easy, 2nd exam awfully worded, final exam: mostly conceptual with few calculations.",
            "Overall, Professor Danaher is a great statistician who cares about her students: there were extra credit assignments, curves on the tests, and frequent announcements to keep us in the loop. However, she reminds me of a middle school teacher. She did not let students leave the lecture hall before class was over and was passive-aggressive at times.",
            "She's very caring. idk why everyone is complaining so much. She holds amazing review sessions that have the type of problems she is going to ask. For our second test, she gave a 5point curve and extra credit. The final was dead easy. she went over questions in the review session or were from Webassin. you can get a good grade with minimal effort.",
            "Most of the issues around Danaher you'll see with any older professor.  She's not amazing by any means, any math class with long powerpoints and fewer examples isn't gonna be great.  Granted, there were several extra credit chances, the tests weren't that hard, and the HW is worth a lot and is easy.  Most of these people yapping are just slackers.",
            "I really don't understand what all the whining and complaining is about in these reviews. I skipped class for most of the semester, and it was still an EXTREMELY easy A. As long as you attend the review sessions before the tests, you'll be fine. Several extra credit opportunities were given. It is YOUR fault if you don't get an A.",
            "Danaher is fine. She doesn't really actually end up teaching much. The lectures are boring, long, and a waste of time seeing as how she doesn't provide practice, or focus on equations and solution techniques. You will be far better off just doing the homework and teaching yourself. The tests are straightforward, just stay on top of hw.",
            "This woman made me consider becoming an air engineer... in the air leaving the roof of EB3.",
            "Not tech savvy in the slightest. I took this course online so the due dates were always a mystery to me. She would assign quizzes that open Friday afternoon/evening and close Sunday night. The course itself wasn't very challenging and I rarely watched the recorded lectures and did fine. Gave a lot of extra credit opportunities.",
            "Professor Danaher is an amazing professor. She obviously cares a lot about her students and wants to see them succeed. She replies promptly to emails and discussion board post. She regularly hosts review sessions before exams. On exams she provides formula sheets and calculator commands. Overall 10/10 and I would take this class again.",
            "Professor Danaher is one of the worst professors at NC State. She reads off the slides and her PowerPoint's are very long. For each chapter expect 3 to 4 PowerPoints 50-60 slides each. She gives zero practice material for the test. Each test also covers many chapters as there are only 2 midterms. Webassigns are constantly being changed.",
            "Professor Danaher wanted the best for her students but clearly is out of her element teaching. Her lectures are boring and she mostly just reads off the slides. Her Webassigns are extremely disorganized and frequently moved around which was confusing. Thankfully, quizzes are online and identical to the WAs while exams are mostly straightforward.",
            "Slides are wordy and copied from the book, assignments are sporadic and inconsistent. Margin of error with problems that are rounded is very small and feel inconsistent. Does not know how to work WebAssign. I love statistics she makes it way more difficult than it should be.",
            "Her tests consistently have questions with no correct answer. For the first exam you could create a formula sheet, after everyone failed it, she chose to provide a more rudimentary formula sheet. Makes no sense. Her syllabus doesn't match any of the due dates and she regularly changes class policies without updating the syllabus.",
            "Worst professor I've had so far. I'm sure she is a very nice person, but she is utterly incompetent when it comes to teaching higher education. Very boring and slide-heavy lectures that left me less knowledgable about statistics than before. Constantly changed assignment dates and tests were far too difficult/different than the HW. NOT tech-savvy.",
            "Professor Danaher is a very kind lady but she is an incompetent professor. Her lectures are horrible, the slides are inaccessibly dull and she just reads them. The homework is unlike the tests and therefore won't prepare you for them. She randomly assigns the homework and quizzes so check Webassign regularly or you'll miss assignments. DO NOT TAKE!"

For example he admits WebAssign is an annoying program, then continues to solely use it for all homework assignments. Sort of lazy during office hours (at times). TEST HEAVY. Not a lot of room to prove you what you've learned.",
            "I'll be honest here, Prof. Bryan is a nice guy. He answers questions, takes his time in office hours, and overall makes a good use of humor in his classes. However, most of the work is Webassign based, translates little into the actual exams. Know the material well, and ignore the web crap. You'll do better in exams. Wish I knew that sooner!",
            "Professor Bryan is a great guy and really nice to talk to. He clearly knows a lot about Calc 3, but his lectures consisted wayyyyy too much of proofs and not enough practice problems. If you take a class with him, make sure to go to his office hours because he will explain the material much more thoroughly there.",

Professor Bryan is well available at office hours. Get ready to love Maths.",

            "The tests were hard and there is not much you can do to prepare for them. Lectures are copied examples straight from the book, and explained very abstractly. The web work was useless and doesn't help prepare you for the test. He is somewhat helpful in office hours.",

His tests were to be expected, no major surprises on them.  There are some topics he doesn't cover as well as others, but overall he teaches the content well.  Word of advice: attend his test review days!",

He lets you know a general idea of what is on the test, but doesn't give practice problems.  Studying lecture examples and Webassign homework problems got me an A+.",
            "He knows what he is talking about, and seems to explain it well, but the tests don't match up with the lectures. You can think you completely understand something in class, but he will add a twist to it on the test, and it is very different from what was taught.",
            "Every one of his lectures are heavy and it is almost impossible to ace this class if you skip. He basically does examples from the online textbook but he explains it in an easy and fun way. Tests can be difficult but if you study hard you should be fine. He doesn't give sample questions on tests though. He's also really really funny.",
            "He's a great professor overall teaching an extremely difficult course. He usually allows for some missing class but for your grade's sake go! Doesn't really use the text book (ie writes his own, surprisingly fair, tests). If you can, take it with this professor",

The class is structured so that you have to learn the material or you won't pass; which is good for people going into stem.  I highly recommend him if you are going into stem",

He is hilarious in-class, and is very approachable. He understands that some of the work he has to assign us is pointless and let's us know that he doesn't like it either. I would take him again",

            "Class and WebAssign were really hard, but that's not his fault. He goes pretty fast but will gladly go back over something if you need clarification. Has a very dry sense of humor and kind of anti-establishment demeanor. Funny guy, decent instructor, tough class. Don't miss a day or you'll be lost for weeks.",

The readings are long and the lectures a bit plain, but if you pay attention then you should be able to understand the material well enough to get a good grade in this class.  Just make sure that you don't use a phone.",

He responded back in all CAPS and in a very condescending manner. Very unprofessional.",

There are no tests, only a rough draft, and a final paper and then one-page \"reviews\" of the readings. He does have a monotone voice, but the information in the class was interesting. Also, he graded easily for this specific class.",

However, as a professor he assigns way too much reading and even if you work for the grade likewise you will not be pleased. Lectures a lot, one thing Ill give him is that he grades the last group project fairly.",
            "Only had two tests the whole semester, which were mainly on the readings outside of class rather than what we learned in class, making it feel worthless to even show up at certain points. Very knowledgeable but can get frustrated in class. Would not take him again because of unnecessarily harsh grading and odd grading system.",
            "This has been the worst class I have taken in my 3 years at NCSU. Each week you are assigned anywhere from 10-130 pages to read and given a four question challenging and arbitrary quiz. I complete all the readings and still get a 50/75 each week which is extremely frustrating. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS CLASS.",
            "He is a nice guy, and the class is not too bad. There aren't many grades besides the readings, which are a pain without help. He is overall a pretty lenient grader on papers. He lectures all of class every day, and is strict on phones, so class takes forever. Overall if you just want to get a requirement, there are better, but otherwise good",
            "Expect pretty long readings almost every night. This class is all about in-class participation, but if you look at the questions for the readings on Moodle it's easy to participate. The book was not really necessary and the lectures were boring but bearable. All in all, it isn't too hard and not too bad for a GEP.",
            "Very knowledgable about the time period and sort of a chill guy. Stands there and talks and talks in the most monotone of voices; you won't make it through the semester without sleeping in class. Tests are impossible to study for, and are only based on the readings not the lectures so taking notes is kind of useless.",
            "Really boring and difficult to approach.  Moves through slides so quickly they are hard to copy down, but that doesn't matter because they are nothing like the test questions.  Hard grader on essays and tests students mostly on things that were never discussed in class and are not obvious in the readings.",
            "This is a difficult class.  There are 2 tests, an essay, and a final.  The tests consist of multiple choice (fill in the blank, etc)and essay.  You must know the readings to do well on the tests because you have to choose the statement that is incorrect on the multiple choice section.  Luria is straightforward will his material.  PPts everyday."

The tests are reasonably difficult but not impossible to get a B in the class. Will have to work very hard for an A.",
            "Dr. Yu was a great professor. Her lectures were really easy to focus on despite being an 8:30 class, and she managed to make the material genuinely interesting. Her exams were tough, but they were fair. Would highly recommend taking any course with Yu given the chance, even if it's in the morning.",
            "This class made me want to take more ECE courses as a mech E student. Dr. Yu explains material clearly and makes the class interesting and engaging. Her tests are fast and pretty scary (similar difficulty to practice tests), but she gives a lot of partial credit for correct technique. Dr. Yu is one of the best professors I have had at NC State!",
            "I really like Dr. Yu, but her tests are an absolute nightmare. Her lectures are engaging and a lot of fun, but the homework and tests are much harder than the examples given. Be prepared to study hard!",
            "302 is a very difficult class, however, Dr. Yu gives you all of the resources and information needed to do well on exams. People who do not do well in this class simply do not try. This is a class where effort and grade are directly related. She is also very funny and a genuine person making 8:30 lectures more bearable and enjoyable.",

            "Great lecture speaker, with plenty of examples. Will work with you to ensure you understand the material and pass the class. Went from a 40 on the first test to an 80 thanks to her help.",
            "Absolutely fantastic teacher, wretched tests. The material appears to be extremely easy in class, but then the homeworks get harder and the test are even worse. She is a very good teacher and is super fun and interactive though, which motivated me to do well in this course",
            "Dr. Yu pretends to listen to her students but actually she doesnt. Shes good at pretending and actually curses you off the scene. Saying same policies again and again like a parrot. Tests are too hard, something you have never seen comes out.",
            "Great at teaching; first time actually understanding voltage/current. Webwork for homework great, tests were hard but doable w/ good EC. Disappointed that material was pretty abstract, not anything that will help me learn hobby electronics, but I couldn't've asked for a better teacher. Never was required to use book but helped understanding a bit",
            "Dr Yu is an awesome professor in my opinion. She does a fairly good job presenting her notes. However, the notes are designed weird since there are no numbers, but symbols. The hws are not terrible and we have connect where we submit the hw multiple times to get 100s. We had quizzes this summer and it wasn't terrible at all. The labs suck though.",
            "One of the best professors that I have ever had. She is a caring teacher meaning if you found yourself lost do not hesitate to ask her help. She knows how to explain the material very well. However, her tests are hard, but it is fine because she teaches us how to think.",
            "Class is tough, exams are hard. Pay attention to lectures as well as study homework before test.",

            "Dr. Yu keeps it real. She's not going to give you the answers, and she's not going to tell you what to do, but she is going to teach you to think. I loved having her as my professor, and would love to have her teach another of my classes.",
            "She's extremely interactive and helpful. She's a liberal grader and her concise quizzes at regular intervals reduce stress. The only downside to her class is the excessive number of homework problems every week.",

She is a very clear lecturer, and her biweekly quizzes which replace midterm exams are EXACTLY LIKE THE PRACTICE QUIZZES with slightly different setups.  There really is no reason not to get an A in this class as she is very liberal with partial credit.",

However, Dr. Yu makes an effort to get to know every student in her class and is more than willing to help you personally. She is clear about what you have to know for exams and will give you the knowledge you need."

She is impossible to reach outside of class. She is unorganized and messy. Cant say I learned anything, this class is just free labor, useless busy work and countless hours.",
            "Miss Mindy's class was a blast to participate in. She's funny but also cares about her students. The content of your speeches is graded pretty strictly but you do know exactly what you need to put into it to get full marks. Would definitely take again",
            "I know ppl love her but not me. Shes not covid safe, this class is a lot of work for no reason, and a lot of actual time class I felt like I learned nothing. You can probably get through it but with the work and volunteer hours shes asking for this should be a 4 credit class.",

She has her favorites and if you are not one of them, as long as you demonstrate that you are willing to work for it, she will like you. Her assignments are do-able, but most of the points deducted are from grammar and not following her guidelines.",

Try not to miss class and get your hw done on time. She can be nitpicky with grades but you can get an A if you take if seriously.",
            "Should be 4 credits & has a lot of fluff. The assignments and grading are so extra, but if you participate you'll be ok. The class was a lot of work, but evenly spread. The experience with the nonprofits is great. If you have bad grammar I'd really be extra cautious because that'll ruin your grade. She is very involved with her students and kind",
            "Miss Mindy is a one-of-a-kind professor!! She is such a genuine person who cares for each student. Her course requires a great amount of time and hard work. Any student who takes COM466 will leave as a better writer and much more experienced in the professional world. THIS IS A GREAT NETWORKING OPPORTUNITY!!!",

This class is stupid easy, the only way you'll fail is if you skip class more than once or you literally don't do anything. She tends to run late to class, & since we didn't have a RM, we were just sitting around texting for the 1st 14 min. You know the 15 min \"no show\" rule",

She goes above and beyond for her students. She genuinely cares about each student and wants everyone to succeed. Awesome professor!",
            "In that class, you need to work with a non-profit partner for at least 25 hours and write 5 feddback papers on it. You also need a presentation.

The exams were fairly easy minus the fact that to get a 100% you need to read the book. 4 out of 40 questions come from the book. Attendance is mandatory. Topics are very interesting.",

The exams are pretty rough, unless you have studied a lot. He covers a lot of information, but the final isn't cumulative, so I guess that's a plus.",

He tells you which pages to study for the written exam at the beginning of the year, so the written final is an easy A.",

Pollard tells great stories and gives you opportunities for extra credit, such as a balloon shoot and an end-of-year \"deer hunt\" where he sets up deer targets and gives you venison sausage he caught and cooked himself as a reward for kill shots. He told me if I'd taken it graded, I would've gotten an A-",

He truly cares for his students and is a fun, encouraging professor.",

Exams are difficult and very specific. The lab is fun and easy. Take good notes and pay attention in lectures and you will do well. (I took it Spring 2023)",
            "In my opinion, he is not a great teacher. He reads off slides made in 2015, and then he tests you with 10+ pages of impossible short answer/long answer tests. If you don't spend every waking minute of your life studying for his class it quickly becomes impossible. With that being said he is receptive to emails, but this class was a nightmare.",
            "Dr. Poole is very clear on his goal on 220: he wants you to be able to think critically and be able to apply or link it into the real-world reproduction industry. He is very receptive and do ask questions if you have because he would be happy to answer them. Like he said everyone was once a beginner. You can get a lot out from this class.",

The exams are very long with short answer questions but if you study and try, you will succeed in the course. He cares about students and their successes as long as you apply yourself and ask for help.",

I hate how he is the only professor that teaches reproductive physiology because I would definitely take this class with another teacher and I bet it would not be as hard.",
            "Dr. Poole is a fantastic professor, and he tries his best to make the course material interesting. A lot of students fail the tests because they don't make time to study outside of class. Rewatch his lectures and redraw the diagrams he draws. His exams are very in depth. ALWAYS start with the short answer questions FIRST or you'll run out of time.",
            "I thoroughly enjoy his enthusiasm for the course and the depth he goes into while teaching. He doesn't go off on tangents too often and he tries his best to make the course material interesting. As long as you rewatch his lectures (taking notes on what he says) and redraw the diagrams he draws on the board, you are likely to get at least a B.",
            "I feel like overall, Dr. Poole is a good professor. He explains everything well and gives plenty of visual representation of concepts which really helps. I did learn a lot but his exams REALLY get you good. You have to know a lot of tiny details in order to get full credit and you have to be very specific.",

Don't get me wrong, it spent a lot of time reviewing the material and going to his office, but he is so passionate and excited about the material it made class fun and studying not such a chore. Tests are specific but fair if you studied appropriately. Journal activities are simple and quizzes are grade boosters.",
            "Great lecturer, but the exams are extremely hard. If you think you know the material well enough, you don't. He says they are designed for one hour, but there is no way. Every exam feels like a final. You need to every bit of the material down to the letter to do well on his exams. Nice instructor, but his exam averages are always very low.",
            "Go to office hours to review tests/material and you will be fine. He has been very understanding of people and their schedules during the pandemic. Tests are tough and applied, but doable if you study enough. 2 Journal articles that were not graded tough. No final, only have to take the first three tests if you have an A . Take the quizzes!",
            "Poole claims to care about his students, but I would not rely on him to help you out. You need to look out for yourself and do whatever you can to help prepare yourself for the class. There aren't many things graded, the tests are hard and weighted heavily. Beware that he will put things on the test that he barely went over and expects you to know.",

I enjoyed his teaching style and his class. This course was tough, the tests were hard and made it out with a C.  Put some serious effort into this class just for the quizzes and tests!"

            "Took the class as distance education. Two midterms (and final) were both on Moodle, and only a few assignments outside of that. If you put in a small amount of time every week, you can easily succeed in this class.",
            "This class was an easy A. Every project I got 100 on that I turned in. Also got 6 excused absences which was nice.",
            "Demetris is an okay professor but does not have clear grading criteria. She is very unorganized, and the class often feels like a \"yap\" session. She seems very disinterested in teaching and more into her role at Github!",
            "Professor is extremely disorganized and copied/pasted from years past. Stuff on the syllabus is completely different than what is on Moodle. There never is any clear instructions on projects, but just do your best. Scales by points, and lacks putting in grades.",
            "super cool and fun person with lots of knowledge in the field! lectures can be a bit boring and long, but attendance is mandatory so go to class and get those easy points. all exams are open note, and the projects are easy since she gives clear instructions and examples. overall, you can easily do well if you just do all the assignments!",
            "Cheatham is really sweet and cares more about her students than other professors. She makes the class as stress-free as possible, giving a realistic workload and open-note exams. She's also a very engaging lecturer that knows how to connect with a college audience. Also, very helpful in helping you settle in the professional world.",
            "Professor Cheatham does not grade hard, as that is not the purpose of the course. It is very low stress, which allows for you to take as much in as you want to. Grading consists of projects and exams but all are very easy to understand and get a 100 on if you listen and read directions.",
            "Professor Cheatham was a good teacher, while I didn't apply myself every lecture I still have an A in the class. Attendance is a must but you are allowed 6 absences and 4 workshop days. I'm not sure how the final will look but she gives 3 hours for 40 questions with open notes. Great teacher and definitely would take her class again.",
            "Professor Cheatham is really smart and knows what she is taking about. She restructured her class so this semester we only had 3 large assignments and a final, no group work. Attendance is mandatory but you 6 free absences and some work days. However, do not even bother to email her because her answers rarely help, email the TA instead.",
            "Professor Cheatham knows what she is talking about but her lectures don't really affect your grade(tests and projects) so she leaves it up to you how much you want to learn. I feel like the projects weren't explained very well other than making it look like the examples but got 100 on all of them so I can't complain. Good intro into business start.",
            "Professor Cheatham is a good professor. The class itself was very easy, there are lots of group projects and the tests are pretty easy. You do not have to read the book she gives you for each module. There are a few questions on the test but I would just look up summary of each chapter and that would be fine. Study powerpoints for each test.",
            "I had her class at 8:30 so I didn't go super often but when I did I really enjoyed it. Shes very interactive and made the class pretty fun. The exams are a little hard because they are based only on ted talks and a book for one of them. There is a semester-long project that takes a lot of work but its fun and as long as you do it youll get a 100",
            "Don't know who let her become a prof. Super unorganized and terrible communicator. Her TA carried in terms of admin duties. Only good part of class is that it's so easy to ace w group projects. Randomly sends emails and drops tons of work on you. Overall 1/10 she didn't care about teaching.",
            "There is an expectation in college that a professor will give effort in their class; professor Cheatham does not. There is NO instruction in class. Moodle is full of typos, is very confusing, and contains conflicting information. There is ZERO instruction, I mean literally zero. Definitely does not care about her students. Not much work though.",
            "This class is poorly organized and there isn't a lot of actual teaching happening. Lots of projects with unclear instructions and no real help. A lot of books and articles assigned for the semester. It's not a difficult class but definitely pretty frustrating.",
            "I don't know how it is in-person but the online class is worthless. 2 months into the semester and we've had no instruction from Cheatham. You're given a stack of material at the start of the semester and that's it. The whole semester is group work, you're screwed if you have a bad group. & You grade your peers, the prof gives no direction at all.",
            "The best professor I have ever had! Enriching in education and informative on philanthropy!! The best teacher EVER!!",
            "I dont know why everyone says this class is so easy. Its not. This teacher expects way too much from students. The amount of readings we have to do from different books is ridiculous and dont get me started on the projects. We had to interview 3 entrepreneurs and only given a couple of weeks to do it. While paying for a source to transcribe.",
            "This was her first semester teaching. She's still learning how to teach and I think people are a little harsh on her for no reason. Did I learn much this semester? No. I think this course was overall like an easy easy A. Its nice break. The midterm and final are the only 2 tests and they are take-at-home tests, plus a pretty simple group project.",
            "Mrs. Cheatham was often late (more than 30 minutes), loves to brag about her own success and her resume, our class never lasted more than 40 minutes. Always repeats the same things and changes the slides in live and doesn't put them on Moodle after that. Hopefully for this class, her TA Nathan was here and seemed to know the class better."

While I did have a 2-hour class period, he gave us breaks so we weren't burned out.  He also gives us practice tests that are similar to the actual exam.  The webassign is insanely hard, but that's not his fault.  Great teacher overall.",
            "Ben is a really good teacher. You can't expect Calc 2 to be easy, so the difficulty of the course isn't his fault. He has no control over HW; those questions are way harder than any test. He gives a lot of bonus/extra credit. All the tests you can get up to 105 and our final up to 110; my test average is a 101. You'll like having him!",
            "Lectures for most of the class. Likes to teach and knows the material well. He gives practice tests before the exam which closely resemble exams, which is very beneficial. All you do during class is take notes. Although not his fault, the homework assignments are much more difficult than the material and tests and can take a while to get through.",
            "Ben knows his stuff. He is a great instructor if you are really good at math. If you are not good at math, this class will be difficult. There are a lot of notes to take, and does give study guides that can be similar to the test.",
            "He makes the exams easy and his notes and study guides are helpful. Use them for the test. He cares about your time in answering the questions, while the homework is way more complicated than his exams. It's a lot of copying what he writes in lectures and that's it. Provides his notes online.",
            "(For MA 241 summer course)\nAlthough my first impression wasn't the best, Ben turned out to be a decent prof. In a course with an abundance of challenging material, Ben is very transparent in explaining what bits of information are the most important. His exams are fair and he provides helpful practice tests and study guides to help you prepare",
            "Overall great teacher and worthy of a 5 rating. He is a good listener and always tries to help students understand. If the TA makes a mistake grading a test, he is more than willing to fix it, and above all, he is a fun teacher who can keep the class interesting.",
            "he is genuinely interested in teaching the topics. he would give breaks during the classes and not burn you out. exams are heavily curved, just so as everyone gets good grades. he tries to help everyone out with grades but if you don't put any efforts its not his problem he tries his best.",
            "Don't go by the negative remarks, dude taught for the first time. he is extremely helpful and would basically tell you what is gonna come in the paper if you ask him the right questions. He was a grad student so he understands the problems easily. I didn't even study for exams as I was busy partying and all but his notes and office hours are best !",
            "Ben is a really funny teacher who loves sports and is very energetic. I would say if you have calculus experience from high school, you will breeze through this class. I recommend you go to class at least 1-2 times a week and just look back through notes occasionally. The homework can be difficult to pick up on but overall he's pretty good.",
            "If you did not do good in Ap calc in high school do not take his class. the only reason some people in these reviews found it easy was because they already had experience in calc in high school. I highly recommend not taking this class. The tests are very difficult and no good lecture or good notes are provided.",
            "He isn't a great professor at all. I have never had a hard time with math before. the teacher writes notes for 2 and a half hours and the notes do not even help. The amount of homework we get you would think the notes would help but they don't and it does not help you prepare for the exam. The TA was bad to he didn't clearly explain anything",
            "Most horrible math professors ever do not take. His lectures are him taking notes for the whole time you cant understand him. His notes are not helpful whatsoever. WebAssign homework is no help for the test. bad grader and makes you feel dumb",
            "Benjamin was a solid Calc I professor. He explained things in a way that was a little too complicated for a 100 level class. He would use things from a higher level math to explain things that made no sense. I took AP calc in high school, so take my word for it. However, you should do fine in his class. If you really need to KhanAcademy works well.",
            "Benjamin Daniel is a decent guy but his lectures are very boring. He basically just writes every single sentence he speaks during class and takes 20 minutes on a question that could be done in 5. There is a lot of webassign work though that would not be his fault. He curves tests if required. If you're already good at calc then it won't be too bad",
            "I really like Ben, he makes the expectations for the class very clear & is empathetic to students, even makes jokes to lighten the mood and relate to us. A little hard to understand in the beginning. He's very open to answering questions during class. Lectures are all note-taking but he records them and posts the notes, & he explains them well.",
            "Enjoyable comprehensive lectures with solid notes, webassigns trash but thats not on Ben.",
            "He is very exited to teach classes and runs over to students who have help. The classes are lecture heavy with solo practice problems every once and a while. He writes notes with you, giving you plenty of time to write your notes. Homework is given out per unit so you have to pace yourself with the homework to succeed. Generally, I love the class.",
            "Based on how he moves around the classroom, he skips to a person that has a question, he values his students' success in the classroom. He tries to elevate the mood through some jokes; some work, some do not."

Learned absolutely nothing the entire semester, only passed because I cheated off of other people during exams.",

He genuinely cares about his students success, he is cheerful and encouraging when with smaller groups, and he never means to condescend others\nHis speech and movements are slightly slowed from an injury\nHomework success = Test success\nTests are hard, final grades are curved\nHe wants you to succeed",
            "Professor Ybarra has been the worst professor I have every had. Beyond his condescending attitude and absolute lack of passion for teaching, he is less of an educator and more of a bully. He expects his students to remember everything he says no matter how irrelevant. He seems to care more about making his job easier than educating his students",

If someone is brave enough to ask him a question, he gets visibly frustrated and just repeats what he's already said, not trying to explain any further how to get to the answe",
            "Ybarra isn't the best. He seems to expect us to come into the class with a solid understanding of circuitry, rather than starting from ground zero with the basics. He gets visibly upset with the class while doing examples bc nobody understands how to get the correct answer. He doesn't really answer questions and only repeats what he's already said.",

He constantly skips steps in his work making it impossible to follow.

It's basically a weekly quiz and a presentation from other students and you're out of there. It's an easy A with little HW compared to other professors but other professors offer more connections and guidance I guess.",
            "I'm not exaggerating when I say Prof. Ybarra is the most boring teacher I have ever taken a class with. Perhaps he cares less due to classes being online this semester, but this class is impressively monotonous. He slowly reads right off the slides in a monotone voice all class, and poorly answers questions that arise. Please don't take this class.",
            "I swear he didn't say more than 10 words the entire semester. The TA did everything. The entire class was just come in, take a Kahoot quiz on a video you watched for homework, watch a presentation from another group, and leave. The midterm was just the Kahoot questions. This class is useless and will teach you nothing, but it's an easy A.",
            "Writes down every single word he says and is very monotone. Depending on how much your TA cares, attendance might be \"mandatory\" and the quizzes may actually require you to read the required material.",

Take him and you will show up to class, take a quiz on Kahoot, and then play on your computer until class is up and you continue wondering what the actual heck he was talking about. Easy professor and easy class, would recommend.",

If you ask a question.. he'll just repeat what he said rather than addressing what you don't understand. He does tell you a lot of what will be on the test which is nice.",

His lectures are concise and his homework and test problems are fair, and are directly related to the lecture content. No surprises with this guy, which makes him one of the better professors out there.",
            "Ybarra's lectures are about as boring as they can get, yet you better pay attention to them for when you teach yourself the material later. Expect him to go over material without any clear explanations. Homework in this class isn't to bad, but I wish there was more to help prepare you for his tests.",
            "Very dry and unengaging lectures. His process for explaining the material to the class includes copying book examples while staying nearly silent, and only speaking when either declaring the answer or abruptly answering a student's lingering question. If you take this course with him, be prepared to teach yourself most of the material.",

Also, don't buy the textbook, they give you a free code that \"expires\" but actually doesn't.",

If we didn't have anything to do he let us out early and we didn't have as many assignments as some other classes which was nice.

            "Bob is the best! If you take Com 316 with him you will have tons of writing assignments, but I learned more in his class than I would have had I taken it with someone else. He genuinely cares about all his students and honestly acts like a sweet old grandfather! One of the best teachers I've had at State!",

Just take the time to talk to him, he's cool.",

I wouldn't have nearly the amount of PR stuff in my portfolio if it wasn't for him.  If you need articles/press kit/any PR stuff for your portfolio definitely take this class!",
            "Bob is amazing. His class can get somewhat boring just simply because the concepts of 226 aren't that exciting. But he loves his students and really wants to see them do well. If you have to take this for your major, Bob is who you want. But if you're taking this class because you think it'll be an easy A as a free elective, I wouldn't suggest it.",

Dr. Walden does seem very intelligent but I don't think teaching is what he should be doing. He gives 2 in-semester tests that are worth 25% each and a final worth 50% and no homework to even out bad grades. The tests are confusing! Save yourself",
            "Honestly don't know why I bothered coming to class since he would barely cover what's on tests. Speaking of tests, which are very tricky and hard, there's only 4 and a final and that's it, gives very little to no curve. It's actually a shame because he seems extremely intelligent but teaching is not his suit. Worst professor I've had yet.",
            "DONT TAKE this class with Dr. Walden! The test are really hard, its hard to stay focused, and the class is just boring. To be honest with you, I'm not entirely sure why he still teaches. His other life sounds grand. Oh, If you graduate from NC State and become famous, expect him to call you and ask if he can be your financial Advisor. Just say NO.",
            "Probably the worst professor I've had in my academic career. Never have I failed a class nor received less than a B until I took this class with Walden. He intentionally leaves out sections out of the online lectures so if you miss class you won't do well. Contrary if you attend class you still won't do well. DONT TAKE this class with Dr. Walden!",
            "I don't like this class at all. Professor Walden provides the notes online BUT doesn't email or post the test dates (not even in the syllabus, which is given to you hard copy on the first day... its not even online)... He doesn't explain math problems! tests are half math. If you want to know the test dates, go to class. NO ONLINE HELP AT ALL...",
            "You do not need the textbooks, they don't help at all. Just make sure to go to class and take good notes. You really don't have to know too much about economics to do well, you just have to memorize the main terms that he wants on his annoying fill in the blank tests. Dr. Walden is picky about what he accepts, you will have to fight for points.",
            "By far the worst professor that I have ever had. He will sometimes answer questions, but you can tell that he is annoyed when people ask. His fill in the blank tests are very hard to do well on and you do not need the textbooks, they are absolutely useless. Just focus on the key terms in his powerpoints, which he does not provide online.",
            "If you have a choice, pick a different teacher. None of his lectures are online, he either rambles or speeds through them, and he refuses to answer questions.  He is disrespectful, refuses to allow makeup tests even for legit excuses (ex in the hospital), and his books are useless for the tests.  However, the tests aren't hard if you go to class.",

            "By itself, neither the course nor the material is difficult.  However, Dr. Walden is one of the least helpful professors I've ever dealt with.  To get the notes you must attend class and purchase 4 textbooks (three of which he wrote).  His tests are not hard, just make sure you learn whatever math is required as he will not cover it.",
            "he only provides notes in class, nothing to  help on moodle. His text books are useless. The only grades you get are from the tests which are a fill in the blank for vocab...very very useless. He doesn't have a nicest attitude when you approach him with questions.",
            "I personally hated this class. I did everything I could do fro the course and I got no where. Then when I asked him for some help all he said was o keep doing what I was doing. I asked for help cause the way your say is not helping, not cause I'm and idiot. If your good with this stuff go ahead if not stay away from walden.",
            "Only grades in the class come from tests. They are all fill in the blank. He says he will accept synonyms but a lot of times you must approach him and fight for points back.  Did not provide a moodle page or any online help so you must attend class to be prepared for tests.",
            "Dont buy books, its all about notes. He just wants you to buy his books so he can make some money. But other than that, tests are fill in the blank. Take notes. most is common sense. But only grades are tests. which i didnt like. no hw or anything to factor in with the final grade. tries to make class interesting.",

            "Kasey's lectures are as funny as they are informative. He is very knowledgeable about physics and is a joy to listen to. The phys dept is in charge of all the tests, and they are hard. He prepares you well for the exams, but make sure you feel overprepared because there are only 2 midterms and 1 final.",
            "Wagoner is awesome and I really enjoyed his class even though I don't really like physics. He made a tough subject pretty bearable and I respect him for that. He does his best to work with students. 100% recommend.",
            "Kasey loses points because Physics at State sucks. He's a great lecturer, nice person but the way the class is structured/graded is not forgiving at all. 2 tests make up 45% of your grade. Multiple choice, no partial credit. That sounds nice, but the practice exams are nothing like the real ones. He's great if you already understand the content.",
            "Take Kasey. Kasey Wagoner is THE physics teacher. He is the best teacher I've had at NCSU by a longshot. PY208 isn't an easy class but he frequently asks the class how he as a techer is doing. PY205 and PY208 are weed out classes. The physics department wants you to fail but Kasey doesn't. The tests and homeworks are department run - not his fault.",
            "Awesome lecturer. The physics department overall sucks, so there are a many hw's due throughout the semester. I already took this class in high school but didn't get credit, so I didn't pay a lick of attention in his lectures and he didn't care. A very down to Earth kind of guy. Always willing to help and is very passionate about physics.",
            "Possibly the best teacher I've ever had. He's very big on good learning strategies and teaches in a way that makes everything so easy to understand. I don't even know how he does it. PY208 is not a particularly easy class but anyone could pass any class with Wagoner as your professor.",
            "While I didn't actually have Prof. Wagoner, he was my sub one day when my professor for PY208 was at a conference.  However, in that one lecture I realized this man is a great professor.  He flawlessly explained Gauss's Law, one of the hardest concepts in physics, quite well in just an hour.  Honestly, he rivals Dr. Titus, which is an achievement.",
            "kasey wagoner is the best physics professor at state!! He explained the concepts really well and cared about his students a lot. His teaching was way easier to understand than the other professors. I rearranged my schedule to take him again for physics 2.",
            "PY205 was my first-ever physics class. Exams were really difficult, but Wagoner's lectures were easy to follow & taught concepts well. Sometimes he spent too long on student responses instead of more examples, but Wagoner cares about his students, makes the lectures interesting & entertaining, and is easy to communicate with. 10/10 would recommend",
            "I thought kasey spent too much time explaining things and didn't give us much time to practice, but when he was explaining stuff he tried a little too hard to be inspirational and relatable.  He also asked the class for feedback/answers to questions when we really just wanted to listen to the lecture.  Not terrible, not great",
            "The physics class itself is designed horribly, but as a teacher, Kasey does a good job. If you're looking to cruise by memorizing equations, Kasey isn't the person to take, he explains concepts from the ground up and focuses on answering conceptual questions. However, he is overall kind of weird in class and I've heard he can be unhelpful at times.",
            "He lectures in a way that makes content not seem boring. The department common exams are not so good though. He does teach from concepts, so we can be more prepared for challenging questions on exams. He also does GlowScript and other class experiments to make it easier to digest content. Definitely retaking for his PY 208 in the fall.",
            "Unfortunately, the physics department at State is awful. The exams are far too difficult, but Professor Wagoner does a great job explaining the concepts of the course. He was always open to helping students and had engaging lectures. It's just a shame he has such little control over the course because I am sure he could improve it greatly.",
            "Really great guy.  He teaches very well and does an amazing job at making information as clear as possible.  He as very little control over the structure of the class itself, but he tries his best.  He's a really good, funny, engaging, and concise teacher that just happens to work in a very poorly run department.  Absolutely recommend him.",
            "Dr. Wagoner is a great professor in a terrible department. The lectures are very helpful and he clearly wants you to succeed but the department tests are terrible. He does his best in a bad situation.",
            "Fun as a person, great at explaining the concepts behind the principles. Course is difficult, but that is the fault of the department, Professor Wagoner does what he can within the department's constraints. Very helpful during office hours.",
            "Wagoner is great but the department issued tests are terrible. He focuses more on concepts than example problems. Spends most of the lecture answering students questions.",
            "This is a very difficult class, but Professor Wagoner made it so much better than I expected.  He really cares about his students and will give you the help you need if you ask.  I got an A in the class, but I did have to read the textbook and put in the work outside of class.",
            "All PY 205/208 classes are standardized by having the same exam.  Wagoner is a great lecturer since half the class is content and the other half are example questions to do. Keep up with the physics textbook before lecture since he might not cover everything in lecture from the textbook."

Assignments were rarely explained with ample time for completion and grades were never given back when we were told they would be. The work isn't difficult but it is hard to know what's going on.",

SI was helpful when needed. Tests were normally harder than the practice tests, but extra credit helps a lot. Homework is graded on completion.",

He grades his exams out of 115-130 points, which is nice. If he feels exams are unfair, he curves, but was really weird when it came to weighing the grades.",

I barely scraped by in Orgo 1 but his practice tests were very similar to the actual ones and if you worked through those enough you're golden. Very nice guy too and had many good stories in class even if they were off topic.",
            "Easiest orgo prof by far. Barely any synthesis questions and NO nmr. Practice exams reflect actual exams. If you pay attention to what he says, you'll do absolutely fine. You honestly don't even need the txtbk. I spent far less time on this class as compared to orgo 1, he made it very easy. TAKE HIM!!",
            "Chang is a great choice for orgo 2. His lectures can be all over the place but they are overall good as he always tries to keep us engaged. Tests are worth a lot but he curves if he feels they were too difficult and gives back missed points if the TA misgrades. He gives practice exams from previous semesters, including a practice final.",
            "Dr. Chang is an amazing orgo 2 professor! He really cares about each student succeeding in his course and makes himself accessible. Tests are hard but most of them match the practice exams and he has a curving policy.",
            "The best for orgo 2! He loves talking about lab experiences and playing videos to keep class entertaining. He's very smart and the best at answering questions. Tests have 10-20 extra points, but caps grades at 100. He also curves if he feels his test was unfair or if lots of people did badly. Tests harder than what he teaches, but not too bad.",
            "best orgo 2 professor, he can go off on tangents sometimes but if you go to class and pay attention you will do well in his class. Do the practice tests and you'll be solid. would take it with him again. just a few homework assignments too.",
            "Dr. Chang is a great professor for Orgo II. He occasionally goes off on tangents on the chalkboard talking about his lab, but they serve a good break from note taking. He is clear about what mechanisms and concepts you need to know, and he is very light on synthesis questions, which I did not like. His practice tests are great.",
            "Mr. Chang was a great professor. He is very mechanism heavy so be prepared for that. For every test he gave us a practice test that was pretty close to the actual test. His lectures were a little all over the place and sometimes his writing on the board was messy but I could still follow along.",
            "If you struggled with mechanisms in Orgo I I wouldn't take him. He gives very little to no partial credit on homework and tests, so it's near impossible to get the full points--even if you deserve them. I honestly don't know if he's any worse than the other professors, but don't expect to get points if you didn't get a problem 100% right.",
            "I'm gonna be honest. Wei-Chen Chang is probably the easiest prof you can get for Orgo II. That being said, the man was all over the place. For every test, you would receive a list of random topics that weren't even in the book. No partial credit was given at all, but at least going to class was entirely unnecessary.",
            "Dr. Chang is really cool and I'm sure he wants everyone to succeed, but his lectures are all over the place. It's really important to study ahead of time in Orgo II, and it was hard to know what we were supposed to be getting from lecture. That being said, he focuses on \"why\" instead of memorizing mechanisms, and I feel like I learned a lot.",
            "While Professor Chang is a very approachable and nice guy, his teaching style for an important class like Orgo 2 was not for me. 4 homeworks all semester and were not given back before you took the test so you didnt know what you did wrong/needed to work on. Practice problems, old exams, book chapters and notes were not always helpful for exams"

Tests are simple and if you know the material you will do well.",

When people do ask questions, he often doesn't know how to explain WHY something is done a certain way, so he gives a run-around response basically saying \"well this is this, so this is that\" while pointing.  But tests are easy, so an easy A.",

Dr. Lim gives out extremely detailed notes so for nearly every homework and test problem, theres a very close example problem in the notes.",
            "Dr. Lim is a very nice guy, but a very mediocre professor. He never derived a problem from scratch for us and instead just scrolled through his notes which looked like alphabet soup. We all had to teach ourselves by doing the homework and reading the notes. Many grades were saved because he leaked the final while we took it, invalidating it.",
            "Dr. Lim is a knowledgeable prof. Notes were clear. However, he is incapable of teaching or getting anything across. Took him in the summer, and it was painful to watch his lectures to get somewhere since he focuses on things that dont matter. His midterms were okay. Final was natural selection. Advice: dont take him unless you absolutely have to",

You do have to teach yourself the material but he gives you very detailed notes with examples to help you. Tests are open note and I stopped going to class after the second test because I only learned from his notes.",
            "Dr. Lim was not the best professor for this class. Avoid him like the plague if you can. I got a 67% on the final and that was the average. There was no curve in the class whatsoever, the only reason I passed was because the TA was amazing and gave a lot of partial credit. Multiple people cried during his final.",

He provides written notes for all of his lectures and they are EXTREMELY thorough, even including some example problems. His tests are not that difficult if you know how to do the homework problems and the example problems in the notes.",
            "Had Lim for 4 classes, he was my only option for each. I consider him to be the worst professor I had at any point in my college career. I did not receive good feedback on questions I asked. Graded homework did not give feedback. Only benefit seemed to be that many students quit trying, while I did try, leading to me having decent grades. Terrible!",
            "Dr. Lim seems to get a bad rep and I'm not really sure why. In my opinion, out of all of the other choices of professors for Thermo II, I think he's the most solid choice. He's not the best lecturer but if you do the homework, the practice tests, and use office hours for help with these things, you'll be fine. Easier than Thermo I.",

I've gotten higher than 95 on all my homework, A's on both of my midterm and 100 on the semester project, and I left finals with an overall of B-....... The 3 hours exam was so freaking hard, I didn't finish in 4 hours... and trust me, I studied my ass of for that class. so good lucj if you take him.",

His exams are very hard and require derivations that no one in the class can complete.... which would be fine if they were anything we actually learned. Unorganized and one of the worst professors I've had in CHE",

Semester tests are easy, but the final was incredibly hard and lowered most peoples' grades by two letter grades.  The class did not prepare anyone for the insane final.",
            "Pretty easy, despite the other comments. Yea, he reads from the notes, but that means you'll know what's going to be taught and what's on the test. Don't feel like going to class today? Luckily, you'll still have the notes. He's also really good if you go to his office hours or ask questions in class.",

On the other hand, all his tests are pretty easy, you must know the basics though... If you get him, form a study group and be persistent in working on all the material...",

I watched every lecture except one and they were all so much better than the textbook. He is also a very good story teller.",

Prof. Podurgal is honestly the best professor I have had and this class motivated me to switch into HRM. I highly recommend this professor!!",

I actually like his lectures. He is a great speaker and has funny stories. Really likable guy. Easy A, just look through the slides before tests, I never read the book and got As on tests.",

            "So, I would take this class again but be prepared to read, write and study. Dr. Melton is not a bad professor but he just has a lot of work and information in each class. You got to pay attention to lectures and actually read the class to pass. Although, he is flexible and will always help if you send an email.",
            "I have had plenty of classes, English classes as well, that were demanding and difficult. This professor's expectations are not realistic or helpful. The tests are needlessly hard and the class is not enjoyable due to his attitude. Do not take if you can avoid this class.",
            "For an intro level English class, there were way too many papers and assignments to do. Melton is a very harsh grader and is often condescending, making you feel like you need to be an amazing writer before you even walk into the class. He also explains things to you like you are in high school again.",
            "Dr. Melton was very challenging for an entry level course. Also, very indirect when you ask him any question. Not a very good explainer. But through all of the papers I had to write, he made me a better writer.",
            "Dr. Melton's class was very interesting and I learned a lot. If you are interested in the topic or reading in general this is not a class for you. There are readings before every class and the class itself is like a round table discussion. As well as discussion posts after the class (these are just your personal notes/thoughts.",
            "the classes and readings were fun, but... 2 forum posts per week, 2 paper assignments, a mid-term, term project, and final exam. the mid-term required a whole essay in under 2 hours, and the final required 2 essays in 2 hours. that's just silly for a 200 lvl course. he grades nicely but expects way too much from an elective. sorry but no.",
            "English is not my strong suit, but I thoroughly enjoyed this class. The class is essentially short book reports and peer-reviews, but if you need help, this man will go out of his way to help you. He takes the time to go through everyone's paper and give feedback before the deadline. He is an example of what teachers should be.",
            "The class was fun, but the workload is too much for a 200-level class. You have to write 3-4 essays and the final exam includes writing 2 essays; 1 of which includes using 5 of the readings, 4 analysis of excerpts from the reading (a paragraph for each), and short answer responses within 2 1/2 hours. Way too much work for a 2 1/2-hour-long exam.",
            "Dr. Melton encourages individual student interests when assigning projects and creativity is welcomed. Respects student input, willing to adapt when things dont work (Zoom breakout rooms where only 1-2 students in the group actually participated). Tough grader, gives great feedback. Attend class and complete work assigned and you should do well.",
            "I really enjoyed Dr. Melton as an english 101 professor, I think for a 100 level class he couldve graded a bit easier on certain assignments. Other than that he is a really cool dude and will give you time in class to discuss ideas and work on projects. As long as you just follow the assignment sheets step by step you will be good!",
            "I was placed into this course so I didnt pick the professor, first day of class assigned a 3-5 page paper due by the next class which was 2 days. There are WAY easier english professors, this was super challenging for an entry level english course. He expects you to be an amazing writer, in your freshmen year english class.",
            "Don't take him. Required over 45 readings, some w/ over 100 pages. Test questions ask about very specific things he mentions during class & makes you write 2 essays for the timed final. He answers students questions in a very condescending way, don't even bother asking questions. He also says the word \"right\" after every sentence it's distracting.",
            "Strict grader, lots of homework, nice guy though",
            "TAKE LITERALLY ANY OTHER ENG CLASS. In 5 weeks, I read 3 novels and more than 30 short stories. I wrote (not exaggerating- I counted) 132 pages of double spaced 12-point font Times New Roman text. Comments on my papers were cursory and focused more on formatting than content. 2 exam periods were 24 hours and required 11 and 14 pages to be turned in"

You have a paper due every two weeks and you need to actually take time on them because he can be a tough grader. You have 8 accused absences which is super nice. Make sure you do the readings there short. I recommend this class.",
            "Super chill professor that cares about his students. Lenient grader on essays and enjoys when students participate in class.",
            "Ed Reges is by far the best professor I have had in college. He cares deeply for his students and teaches academic writing with passion. His assignments are pretty average for an ENG101 course but he gives very good feedback for how to improve your writing style and habits. He left me with an experience that was deeply nourishing as a student.",
            "I love Mr. Reges. He is a really cool guy who is very passionate about his students' success. He gave great feedback when I took the class and if he doesn't anymore it's because the English department doesn't reward professors who help their students. Best choice for ENG101.",
            "One of the previous reviews is wrong about his updated grading style. Still gives incredible amounts of feedback and is an insanely good professor. For anyone taking ENG101 and has the opportunity to take Mr. Reges, you will not be sorry that you took him. About every week he cancels one of his classes so it's really only a 3 day week class!!!",
            "Best professor hands down. If you plan to take him in the Fall 2023 semester, just know that he is changing the way he gives feedback. He will no longer give feedback on rough drafts but instead will give A LOT of feedback on the final draft. Still an AMAZING professor. HIGH recommend taking him if you can.",
            "I hate writing and english, but this class was really easy. No busy work and the essays aren't too hard. The readings are short and easy, only lasting for the first month or so. He gives helpful feedback and he's a fair grader. If you listen to the feedback you will get a good grade. I learned a lot more than I expected to. I would take him again.",
            "Mr. Reges was a really good teacher. I personally dont enjoy writing or english yet actually learned concepts and techniques to improve my writing. The entire class is papers. He is not out to get your grade if you simply just try. Show that you are giving effort and have a want to actually improve your writing and you will be fine.",
            "This professor is hilarious, intelligent, and responsible. He answered all my emails within two hours of sending them, he is a fair grader, and explains everything very well. I enjoyed this class and he even gives a few days off for work.",
            "I dreaded ENG101 but Mr. Reges made it easy and fun. He gives plenty of time to complete papers and provides LOTS of feedback on our rough drafts before we have to submit them. He also has 1 on 1 conferences so you have time to get direct help on your assignment. Mr. Reges is also super chill and understanding.",
            "Reges was a fantastic English teacher! He was very personable and friendly with students and it showed in his nuanced and thought-out feedback.",
            "Reges gives excellent feedback on rough drafts and clearly states the requirements for each assignment. If you complete the assignments, you will pass. He is always excited to answer questions and listens to any concerns students may have. Textbook readings are typically short, but he will create pop quizzes so always do the reading.",
            "I loved having Mr. Reges. He was really nice, and you can tell he cares a lot about teaching. He is approachable, and easy going. You write papers, but he gives great feedback on the rough draft before you submit the final draft. I actually looked forward to his class, which is weird to say for an English class. He made learning English fun.",
            "Lots of writing but it's definitely manageable if you put in the effort. Guidelines can sometimes be vague but if you reach out you will receive help. Can tell the teacher enjoys the subject and is receptive to students.",
            "Mr. Reges was extremely helpful when it came to giving feedback. The one-on-one meetings were super useful since he would go over what you need to improve on in just a couple of minutes. There were occasional pop quizzes but if you do the readings and understand the content it'll be simple.",
            "As a transfer student, I've had a lot of exposure to different college professors. However, Mr. Reges is one of a kind. I have never received as much feedback on an assignment as I have from Mr. Reges. He goes out of his way to address mental health, diversity and inclusion, and to ensure that everyone is on the same page. 10/10. Would take again!",
            "Easy grader, good with feedback, relatively funny guy. Lectures most classes but they're not super slow paced. The schedule is structured and you know the expectations for every assignment. Includes personal conferences to talk about each paper and figure out what to work on.",
            "Excellent feedback on assignments, and very understanding of student problems",
            "Prof. Reges was a great professor. We did peer review in class and got individual meetings with him to discuss drafts before each major assignment, so it was really easy to get feedback. I did not feel confident with writing before this class and I think he really helped me.",
            "Mr. Reges is one of the best English teachers I have come across. I learned a lot while in his class. He has 4 major writing assignments, do them and you will pass with an A. He gives excellent feedback, so it is very easy to see where you can improve. My favorite part about his class was the personal conferences he held to discuss the feedback."

I don't recommend seeing him outside of class, but the TAs are pretty helpful. Got 100s on 3/4 test but got a 76 on the other, so make sure to study!! Webassigns are really similar to the tests.",
            "Pretty standard lecture class. Textbook is helpful; you have to buy it for WebAssign access. Test grading depends entirely on TA, can be helpful. Material overall is a bit of a learning curve but not too difficult; it's easy to catch up if you do poorly on a test or homework.",
            "Took Finite Mathematics with him, didn't really show up to class / pay attention and just taught myself the web assigns before the tests and managed to pull out with an A+. Sure it would be even easier if you put in the effort during class time - highly recommend this course and the tests are graded to benefit us with much extra credit.",
            "Dr. Scroggs was not the best professor for this course. However, this was his first semester teaching Finite Math. I would feel very confused after showing up to his class. I eventually found that I could learn the material on my own by using the textbook. The tests were super easy and grading was very lenient. Easy A! Just put forth your time!",
            "While a nice guy he's just not a good math professor. I learned everything either on my own or in the review sessions with the TA's. I'd try to take this class with another professor if possible. The class itself is not very challenging, but I did struggle with the first test because he didn't teach well. He also makes plenty of mistakes in lecture",
            "He lowered my homework average by like, 6% because he used some weird formula. Most profs just take all your homework and average it, his weird formula pretty much killed my grade smh.",
            "He constantly makes small mistakes while solving problems which leaves the responsibility of correcting him up to the students who are able to understand what is happening. It makes him appear unprepared. The webassigns are extremely useful for learning the material and are a great substitute for in-class learning. Also, beware the second test.",
            "He spelled Walmart as Wallmart.",

His notes are unreadable and hard to follow. Buy the calculator bc you will need it the latter part of semester. Don't recommend.",
            "He is really nice, but so hard to understand. He doesn't make it easy to learn and often had to teach myself the material. He has awful handwriting and note taking skills. And homework at least 3-4 times a week. I would suggest taking another teacher. I really hate giving a bad review bc he is so nice.",
            "Very sweet professor.  Really seems to want to help but not fantastic with communication.  Likes to make jokes to warm students up.  He gives pop quizzes but they are only extra credit so attendance is not mandatory.  He follows the textbook to the letter, not exaggerating.  He spends the whole lecture just reading from the book.  Just practice.",
            "Dr. Scroggs is overall a terrible teacher in every way. You will not learn anything and is misleading sometimes. He said there would be a curve at the end, nut that never happened.",
            "Lousy professor. Didn't really teach, the best that you could hope for was for him to give you some code for the homework problems. His style of grading is draconian and it is very easy to turn an A into a C.",
            "Dr. Scroggs is a terrible teacher, you're better off learning everything on your own.",
            "Probably the Worst and unhelpful professor ever ever. Never expect you can learn something from his lecture. He cannot code himself. When you ask a question , he is extremely impatient and rude to students. Grade scale is OK ,but you need learn everything yourself. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS, AND AVOID ADVISING FROM HIM.",
            "Horrible professor. First time I attend a programming class and the professor doesn't even tell you how to program. He is just rambling about the math theories all class and expect you to figure out how to code those things out yourself. If you have a choice, never take his class",

All I had to do was write and the writing assignments were not hard. Just 4 papers. Take them if you have the chance!",
            "Mx. Clayton is AMAZING!! Their class was engaging and I actually looked forward to their class, even though I am not a fan of writing. I could tell they care so much about the students and took student input into most assignments.",
            "Jacob has a clear, concise teaching pattern that allows his students to follow along logically. He encourages group discussion and individually coming to knowledge as we discuss in class. He wants diversity of opinions and makes it known that it is important that you read. There were some quizzes in class. Overall a great professor",
            "Professor Clayton is amazing and very understanding. They give great feedback, have plenty of time to complete assignments, and they are very good at giving feedback on current and past assignments. If you have the chance, they are definitely the professor to take.",
            "He is the most understanding professor out of all of my professors that I have so far in this semester. He may be a tough grader at times, but he gives great feedback on papers and an optional redo of the first paper. I recommend visiting his office hours if you have doubts about your papers. In-class discussions are good as well.",
            "They are a great professor and very willing to help you! Claytons lectures were engaging and always helped put students on the right path for the papers.

They don't grade papers too harshly, and are very understanding and accesible to students who need to adjust due dates. The whole course grade is evenly split between 4 papers and participation, but there are small assignments due every week. Overall very glad I had this prof.",

They are really awesome give good feedback and genuinely seem passionate about their job. They also have all in and you actually use the textbook. Definite gem !!!",
            "There are four major projects and this is mostly where your grades come from. Professor Clayton has peer-review meetings for almost every paper done in class, make sure to take these seriously, participation is a huge grade and these sessions can determine whether your paper receives an A or a C. Awesome professor and interesting class.",
            "Best English class I've taken! Don't get me wrong, there was always work to do but Professor Clayton genuinely cared about me and gave super helpful constructive feedback. He was clear about what he expected for each paper and was very accessible during office hours. I had to work for my grade but I'm a better writer because of this class.",
            "I love Prof. Clayton! One of the kindest professors I've ever had. All feedback was very thorough and actually helped me learn. My class was asynchronous because of Covid so attendance wasn't an issue. We used the textbook a handful of times to help us write our essays but nothing too rigorous. Prof. Clayton is very understanding and really cares!",
            "Prof Clayton was great. He made English 101 simple. You have to work hard to get an A but it is not impossible. I took this class hybrid and it was definitely worth it as the online assignments were only graded for participation.",

With every major paper assignment, he schedules one-on-one meetings for extra help. Overall I loved his class and I would have him as a professor again :-)",

Tests aren't terribly difficult and neither are the weekly quizzes. Go to class and listen to the lectures (though you'll be tempted to skip) because they are a source for numerous test questions.",

He tells you what to expect on the weekly quizzes so make sure you remember that. Get ready to read a play per weekend, shmooping doesn't always work b/c he asks about certain lines.",

            "I didn't take his class seriously enough and I didn't do very well, but if you put in the effort it's not hard to make a good grade. He tells you before the tests what you'll need to know. If you don't like Shakespeare, he explains it in a funny way that makes it enjoyable, but be prepared to read outside of class (one play per week).",

His jokes get stale but thats part of the charm.  Reading the plays is highly recommended.  This class took me from a staunch anti-Shakespearean to someone who enjoys quite enjoys his plays.",

He dumbs down the material, and treats students' ideas, even if they're good, with hostility.  You will also get tired of his jokes within the first two weeks, but that won't stop him from telling them.",

The papers can be a little bit of a pain while writing them, but as long as you are a decent writer you will be fine. He does grade kind of harshly, but he gives great feedback. His lectures are very interesting",
            "One of the nicest professors I have had at State, you can tell he genuinely cares and tries to make class fun for everyone. Not a super harsh grader and is very straightforward with what he expects. Awesome guy.",
            "Prof. Porter has given me much insight into research methods and writing styles. He only requires 3 major papers where he guides us through the steps of research and drafting. While he doesn't have a rubric, he grades very nicely. He's accessible during office hours to proofread my paper and makes his lectures very engaging and fun. -HY",

            "Hands down the most enjoyable English class I have ever taken, and Porter is the reason for it. You won't be hunched over readings or suffering through lectures. Rather you'll be reading, writing, and watching the things that you find interesting. Porter is the most caring guy in the world, and an ounce of your effort leads to a pound of his",
            "Mr Porter is the GOAT of the English department. Matthew is kind, respectful, responsive, professional, and sincere. Matthew is a great teacher and a wonderful mentor and if you're struggling he'll try his best to help you. Fair warning the essays are a bit of a pain but if you're decent at writing you'll do fine.",

As much as the walk to Tompkins hall sucks and 8:30s aren't fun, Mr. Porter's class made me excited to be up in the morning.",

            "Matt is a great professor, one of my favorites so far. I took him for an online summer class during COVID, and even online his desire to help students learn the course material is impeccable. He can be a tough grader, but the feedback he gives is always helpful and never discouraging. Matt was always available outside of class, too.",
            "Mr. Porter has honestly been one of the best professors I've had so far. You have to write about four different papers of varying lengths which isn't always the most fun, but it's an English class. He is extremely responsive outside of class and makes sure that you know he is there to help you with whatever you need.",
            "Tough grader, but always gives great feedback and makes the class interesting. Only 4 papers that weren't too difficult and they were pretty fun to write, even if they may seem a bit intimidating at first, and he's always willing to help.",

He's very clear with his instructions, hilarious in class, and truly cares about his students. He will literally do whatever he can to help you, too. There's 4 papers, but we work on them in class a lot. TAKE HIS CLASS!!",
            "Porter is a great guy. He's entertaining and helpful. The class is not too difficult, but if you're struggling he will help you as much as he can. I would recommend taking his class.",
            "He really wants you to pass, doesn't always take attendance when he knows you're nearing your missed class limit, gives great feedback and tries to help you pass, homework assignments are easy readings, we had 4 papers throughout the semester and none of them were hard. Would 100% recommend taking his class. He's really funny too!!",
            "I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Porter. The class can be slow until a paper is due, just make sure to work on your essays when he says and you will do fine. He is very clear. He gives very clear directions and is always open to questions. He wants everyone to do well. He's always available after class or through email. Great sense of humor too. Take Porter!",

Take the classes and assignments seriously, bring an open mind and a good attitude with you, and you will do well.",

The final project consisted of making a marketing plan for one artist that you do a project on throughout the semester, if you set the time aside to do it you will be fine. The tests are not hard if you go to class.",

He is also a bit extra for an assignment where you have to write four sentences (ie it's not even an essay or anything), we had to print it out as apparently handwritten is not good enough for him.",

It's all about reading the textbooks, and picking out the important info. Except, he tries to teach it like it's 370, which doesn't work. He doesn't tell you what he will test you on, you just have to guess.",

            "Dr. Beckman is probably THE best teacher I've ever had. He has so much passion for his subject and his students. The material can be a little dry at times, but I guarantee you will walk away with the knowledge he was trying to impart, and you won't be likely to forget it. Tests are ridiculously easy if you just attend class and review the notes.",

Tests can be a bit difficult, but not too bad if you study (he gives a summary sheet with all material covered at the end of each class, and takes test questions directly from those).

All equipment is provided.\nThe only meh thing about this class is that you aren't free from cardio. He will accommodate if you have health issues, but if you're taking archery to avoid exercising, look for a different prof.",
            "Dr. Lee is the best fitness instructor at State! He is so sweet and funny, and he always wants to make sure his students are safe and doing their best. He grades a bit tough for the two demonstration exams in the semester, but I appreciate his feedback. I always felt safe practicing and asking him for help during class",
            "Dr. Lee is so sweet. I am very bad at PE but was able to pass this class and have fun along the way. He's very encouraging and good-hearted. When I was struggling at one point, he structured an entire lesson around fixing the problem I was having. Final grade is participation (20%), level shoots (20%), score shoots (30%), and a written exam (30%).",

Rachana Gupta grades on what seems to be arbitrary preference for the student, so you will either have a great experience if she decides she likes you, and horrible otherwise. Papers for the class are busy work that will not relate to your project and have no rubric.",

You obviously have to work but the expectations are realistic and she has the technical background to help you out especially if your project involves software.",

She will help you think about things you possibly have not thought of or highlight areas of weakness that you might have overlooked in your project. This is VERY helpful for your professional development. She can spot a slacker from a mile away! Easy A if you put forth honest effort. LOVE HER!",

The course was not at all well structured, it seemed very easy at first, but then suddenly got very difficult towards the middle of the semester. Raspberry Pi projects are interesting for undergrads, but they really don't do justice to seniors or grad students.",

            "Terrible. Lectures are painfully dry and bleak. He makes me want to crawl into a cave. Completely unfair grader, who offers little to no partial credit. I don't learn anything from him, so I have to learn the material all by myself in my own time. Absolute horrendous and should be terminated from his job.",
            "Don't do it",
            "I honestly don't understand why Dr. Doyle is not on academic probation. He comes to class, fumbles through already complicated examples, and then expects you to understand concepts and notation flawlessly. If you have to choose between taking Doyle or not taking the class, don't take the class.",
            "He was never prepared for class. Always got confused even when giving examples from the textbook. Gave a lot of homeworks (13!).",
            "Don't.",
            "Makes the homeworks very difficult and then weights them 60% of the grade. Also makes the midterm easy (class average 87) and then makes the final exam much harder (class avg 75). Easily confused in class by his own examples. Does not give any help with grades (i.e. extra credit or curves)",
            "Dr. Doyle was NEVER prepared for class. He did not even act like he cared about the material, let alone showed interest in teaching it. He consistently fouled up examples in class (even though they were straight out of the book). Most HW's were easy, midterm was easy, but he made final ridiculously HARD! It included material we never even covered.",
            "This was the worst course I have taken at NCSU.  Like most of the comments from this sem., Doyle didn't do a good job of explaining concepts in class.  The final exam was excruciatingly difficult, and not a good indicator of what I had learned through the HWs.  I regret not dropping this course and taking it with a different instructor another sem.",
            "Lectures are scatterbrained and poorly prepared. Examples in class were either done incorrectly or not at all. Doyle stumbles awkwardly over even the most basic concepts of the course and asked THE STUDENTS for clarification as to whether or not he covered topics correctly. Only benefit: good grade distribution, probably the result of a HUGE curve.",
            "The last two descriptions are pretty accurate. Doyle is friendly and very smart, but things are often lost in translation and he can sometimes be less than clear with expectations. Buy the book and make smart friends to supplement lecture.",
            "He's usually prepared for class just like the previous comment said. He almost never solves the problems right on the board yet he takes off a lot of points on exams when we get a part of it wrong :( Not a great choice.",
            "It doesn't seem like Doyle practices his lectures before coming to class. I don't know how he expects us to do well if he cannot solve examples in the book on the first try. He will get halfway through a problem, find out he's wrong, then spend half the class period trying to figure out where he goofed up. Even then, it's still not right in the end",
            "He has a way of making complex stuff easier. Is his class the easiest of all time? No. But part of that is the difficulty of the material which he tries, and often succeeds at, making fairly clear. He likes take home tests that are basically just expanded homework problems. I would take class wit him again",
            "Very effective teacher. His lecture notes are directly related to the homework and the textbook is useful. His teaching style is very structured and he is highly organized. His course requires a quaintness for mathematical proofs, but mostly an ability to think logically. His exams are appropriate for the course material. I highly recommend him.",
            "I didn't expect to enjoy this class, but it really wasn't too bad.  This class is highly structured, and if you do all his practice tests and homeworks, you will do good.  The material isn't easy, but anyone who puts in enough effort should easily pass.",
            "Does not respond to e-mails, not very helpful.",

            "Very easy for a psych credit or free elective. can get by without reading textbook. she is a great and caring professor",
            "Never got to really meet her because it was an online class but genuinely the best professor I've had. She assigns 1 assignment each week based on easy lectures and the tests are straight out of the notes. She's super caring and the class is honestly super interesting which kept me engaged. Would take this over and over if I could!",
            "If you're looking for an easy online class to take, I definitely recommend this class! 4 exams and a small final. Open-note and consist of multiple-choice and short answer questions. Lots of resources. A short assignment/quiz due each week but they're very easy. Two very short papers, not graded harshly. Interesting material! Overall great class!",
            "Easy online class. Dr. Burnette checks in every week with her students which I loved. There are five long exams, which is obviously pretty tedious; however, none were that hard. The material is actually pretty interesting. Besides exams, you have a few papers and short quizzes to do. Some weeks there were no graded assignments. Super leisurely.",
            "Great professor!! I typically struggle with online courses but this was not the case with her class!!",
            "Take this class! It is very self-paced and doesn't require much work to keep up. The tests are open book/note, so as long as you have the materials the tests are easy. The material is really interesting and Dr. Burnette is very accessible and wants her students to succeed.",
            "I took this course online, but I still learned so much from it. She provides a simple and self-paced class structure. All of the quizzes were super easy as long as you did the readings. Tests were a bit more challenging but very reasonable. This is a great class to take online and shes a great instructor if you stay on top of things.",
            "I loved this class and would definitely recommend it to everyone. The assignments were easy and interesting, usually it was just reading a chapter of a textbook and doing a related assignment, but the topics were relevant and easy to follow. The professor made sure to email us offering to provide help and seemed genuinely interested and kind.",
            "Being honest, I could've tried harder in Professor Burnette's class, but the fact of the matter is that she didn't make me want to. The entire class lacked structure-- you pretty much just had to read the textbook, maybe take a quiz or two, and do tests. This is NOT the class to take if you procrastinate, because the tests go exactly by the book.",
            "This class was good and easy. As long as you read and studied, you would be good for the tests. The workload wasn't super heavy. Because this class was online, it was pretty boring and difficult to get engaged with the material, but the professor does try to make it better and is always available to answer questions.",
            "Super nice but the class wasn't structured for you to learn, only for you to get through checkpoints and pass. Psychology is my major and I love it so I did pay attention to every lesson but still, indirect teaching methods suck. Easy class and cool topic but not the best prof (just doesn't fit my preferred style). Loved her though!",
            "I took this class online and it wasn't a large time commitment at all. I would do all the assignments for the week in one sitting and get good grades. I recommend taking this course if you need an extra class but already have a tough course load.",
            "Take PSY311 online! It is a breeze and a nice GPA booster if you need it. The grade distributions for the class are great, and there isn't much work at all for the class. Loved it.",
            "Dr. Burnette is a solid choice for PSY 311! Her class is essentially all lecture and is only graded on tests, but it's fairly easy. She gives a clear outline in the lectures of the types of questions that will be asked on the test. So long as you study in depth before the tests, you will do well in the class.",
            "Dr. Burnette moves fast through lectures, but material comes almost directly from the book, so reading beforehand helps. You can do fine without reading though. There are a lot of extra credit points. Tests are good if you study. One, one page paper.  She reviews a lot in class, and works hard to make sure people are prepared for tests.",
            "Very boring class. Subject material is very difficult and there is a lot of it. I would not suggest taking this class unless you have too. VERY HARD CLASS!!! BEWARE",
            "Dr. Burnette was extremely passionate about her subject. However, the topic is extremely dull and the lectures are very long and boring. She moves very fast.  She is very helpful outside of her class and I would strongly recommend attending her office hours if you need help because she is very receptive to feedback and very approachable.",
            "Definitely take her if you get the chance. She's really nice and a great professor. She gave my class several easy extra credit opportunities throughout the semester and her class lectures were interesting and easy to understand. not too many assignments and tests can be a bit difficult but as long as you go to class and study you should be fine."

He removed the major project from the syllabus so now there are only 3 quizzes (taken on Moodle), 3 case studies, some hw assignments, and a final. Hard, but not time consuming",
            "The lectures and readings aren't bad, but as a teacher he is horrible.  Not helpful at all.  There is a huge group project that is 30% of your grade, and the guidelines are so vague.  It's impossible to get a god grade.  The test are impossible if you don't have previous ones.  Only offered online now.",

He gives no preparation to what to expect on the tests which are very difficult. He is smart about the subject but is horrible when it comes to teaching the material. If you take this class, goodluck on the tests, no one passes!",

            "Work heavy, constant reading, no room for other classes, and super harsh grader. If you do not complete her assignments with perfection, good luck making above the 50s on your assignments. Would not recommend taking her class",
            "Someone needs to explain to this teacher that students have more than one class. Every Monday and Wednesday we have at least 2 different assignments due and often times more if we have a group assignment. 2hrs of class lecture and then additional lecture videos. A ridiculous amount of work.",
            "Unrealistic expectations, hope you aren't taking any other difficult classes in the semester. Withholds lectures and exam review questions from class if you do not attend. Attendance is essentially a RNG as you have to be selected in class to receive your attendance point for the day. You will learn a ton about audit, but extreme stress. Takeonline",
            "Little to no instruction, have to look at outside resources for A CHANCE of a 100 - which is very unlikely, since grading is extremely harsh. Always reading and doing group work - don't forget the homework, and lecture videos too. Try to participate only to not be called on, then I loose points because it is my fault. I rather be drafted for war.",
            "The class is arguably the toughest class in the business school, so be prepared. Expect lots of work and tons of group projects and tough tests. Professor is okay, but there is definitely room for improvement. Tough grader and expects too much out of undergraduate students.",
            "Too much of an emphasis on group work; it did not give me the feel of \"teamwork\" and \"collaboration\" that she claimed we needed to experience. Also, just because we performed similarly on exams to previous classes does not mean that one's teaching is excellent--especially when the averages on exams are subpar (C or lower). Work-life balance sucked.",
            "The other comments are true. This class is unbelievably hard!",
            "I have made it through the entirety of my education without feeling the need to warn people about a class, but this one is someting special. Ridiculous work loads, vague instruction, and blisteringly hard tests make this class tanamount to hell on campus. Avoid at all costs. The main issue is the extreme difficulty coupled with vague instruction.",
            "First off she doesn't teach you. You read the book and are expected to be master auditors after that and then she uses class time to go over homework. She gives zero hints on any case studies or even for up coming tests and grades both extremely harshly, so you are basically on your own. This 3 credit class feels like 9 credits of work. GL!",
            "This class is awful. The expectations are just unrealistic!",
            "She has high expectations and requires a lot of work. This would be alright if she clearly outlined expectations or gave some sort of grading rubric for assignments. Not a bad professor as is, but makes it very very hard to do well.",
            "This class is very difficult and has a lot of work but Professor Stainback is a great teacher and is always willing to help you.",
            "Professor Stainback is a wonderful professor! This course is very challenging but I know it is preparing me for my future in accounting.",
            "Avoid taking this class with her if possible. She is new and definitely needs to learn about work balance.",
            "Unfair expectations - we have other classes",
            "A RIDICULOUS amount of work. She means well and wants students to learn, but like the other review said, you won't catch a break. A 3 credit hour class that feels more like 9. Hope to God she curves or dials back on some of the work.",
            "She sent an email with homework before the semester started. If you think you dont have anything to do while taking this class, think again because youre probably forgetting something. A quiz, hw, discussion, and project due on the same day, you wont get a break."

            "Dr. Lin is retiring now, so nobody will probably read this, but Dr. Lin was one of my favorite teachers. He was always very kind and passionate about his work. He knew the material in and out and it was an honor to have studied under him.",
            "Accent doesn't help him but the rest of his teaching definitely does. Often times he'll say you can do this then he'll explain it a moment later. Extremely extremely receptive out of class, and even on the weekends. HW is exactly what it's meant to be: for learning and not for an assessment. Take this man and enjoy a quality professor.",
            "He is very lenient with grading and has been very supportive. He's not the best with technology and Zoom classes are often interrupted. I learn more from reading the textbook, lectures are OK. He gives the homework solutions in advance and says that imitation is a good tool to practice math and still gives full credit for HW over 2 weeks late.",
            "Terrible. He doesn't even have an actual syllabus. It's an excel file with almost no information other than the test dates and schedule. He doesn't pre-record videos so that he doesn't have to prepare for the lectures. For some reason, he also posts the solutions for homework assignments before the due date (not quite sure why).",
            "I was a physics major in the 1990's, and Dr. Lin was a refreshing change from the arduous grading criteria of other instructors. Others seemed to enjoy giving difficult, arbitrary tests, that were stringently graded. Do the homework, pay attention, and the tests are more than fair.",
            "Dr. Lin doesn't seem to know calculus 3 well enough to teach it. His lectures are pathetic and confusing, he just reads off of his (often incorrect) notes he's copied from the textbook. That said, his tests are far easier than other calc professors, and the final is open note. I would only recommend him if you're comfortable teaching yourself.",
            "Not the best English. Always helpful though. VERY EASY GRADER, for an otherwise difficult course.",
            "Makes no sense ever. Refuses to do actual practice problems. BUY THE BOOK and just study that during class. Even Khan Academy is more helpful than listening.",
            "I don't mind the accent, his English is not hard to understand but his teaching is. He doesn't prepare example problems just types up the main points from the textbook sections and lectures about them. It is true that he is merciful when grading tests, but if you actually want to learn Calc be prepared to buy the textbook and teach yourself.",
            "easy grader. I did not know anything and got a 94% on the first test. Take this class!!! He even lets you turn homework in late for full credit :)",
            "Hard to understand, but the best grader ever. Posts solutions before work is due, tests are open note. Great guy, funny too.",
            "He's a really funny and nice guy. He grades obscenely easily, and he's more than willing to help out.. but unfortunately he has a very difficult time communicating, so he teachers poorly, and you'll have to rely on the book (but the tests are so easy and graded so leniently that will be no problem.) I'd recommend.",
            "Incomprehensible. However, if you teach yourself using the textbook, then he's great. He goes by the book (so no extra bs) and posts solutions to homework problems ahead of time. The exams aren't difficult. Additionally, he lets you use your notes on the final exam. As a person, he's nice and pretty funny.",
            "Even though he has some chinese accent, but he is extremely helpful and his MA425 is the eastest one you can find in all professors, MA425 is the most difficult ocurse, so take his 425 , open notes, straight exam. Highly recommend.",
            "I depended entirely upon my calculator.",
            "A little hard to understand.  The tests were pretty straight forward.",
            "Yes, I do realize that calculus 2 is a very difficult course, but this guy is simply not a very clear teacher.  He can be helpful, though.  Tests are misrepresentative of material coverage, focusing too much on more difficult material."

He cares more about students understanding the concepts and proof process than little details, and is very responsive to emails. He also gives out helpful review sheets and is very encouraging to students. He is a real gem in the math dept.",
            "The class overall is quite challenging but his lectures really help explain all the concepts and also hint to do the hw. Do go to office hour for hw help. I personally think his tests were do-able if you do study for them. He's very responsive to students' emails. Overall he's very caring and understanding. Best math teacher at state.",
            "Professor Manion is easily one of the best Calc Professors to take here at State. He goes more in-depth than other professors but still makes sure that we understand the material. Additionally, he makes himself available outside of class all the time, and will quickly respond to any questions.",
            "He is very passionate about math and will be teaching many graduate level classes. His passion means his lectures are fast and dense, but you absolutely learn everything. He is great at quick, useful email responses. He also is an understanding grader and doesn't deduct any/much points for simplification/algebra errors if you understand the concept",
            "I would say Andrew Manion was a literal god for a class like this. He drops multiple lowest hw assignments, lowest exam grade (4 exams), he's a really fun prof and his lectures are actually so captivating and SO clear to understand, almost never left completely lost and when I did he answered emails in under an hour 1000000/10 recommend this man.",
            "I might venture to say his teaching is perfect. Rigorous yet clear lectures, lenient grading, interesting HWs (Fourier stuff & tensors in intro analysis class!) with lots of hints, and a wonderful person of course. It's sad that he'll leave USC this fall. If you are reading this and find him teaching at your college, sign up. You will NOT regret.",
            "Easily best math class Ive taken at USC thanks to Prof. Andy Manion. Truly makes you fall in love with Analysis if you werent already. If youre an algebra kind of person, thats also OK because a lot of algebraic concepts are introduced in the homeworks (esp. w.r.t. differential forms and tangent spaces).",
            "One of the best professors in USC's maths department. Classes are structured clearly and he sometimes extends beyond what's covered in the textbook--won't be tested. Focuses on teaching you how to THINK like a mathematician instead of just acing exams. Office hours are truly an intellectual enjoyment. Very lenient on deadlines and homework.",
            "Super good professor. Took this class in high school too, so that did help me and I didn't fully pay attention, but when I was confused he was very helpful. Explained everything so in depth and gave good examples of how to do things. He really cared more about teaching everyone all of the content and not making the class hard.",
            "Best math teacher out there, very caring. Take him",
            "An amazing professor who is passionate about math and so kind to his students! He always went out of his way to make our lives easier, like offering multiple midterm dates so we could space out our schedules.",
            "This man is amazing at explaining things. Very accessible professor; he can really unpack the most complicated concepts and was also very understanding during this semester. No quiz section and gives homework that you can actually do.",
            "1) No weekly quizzes. 2) Lectures are uniquely structured & brilliantly taught. He DOES cover topics related to but beyond the scope of 226 but if you can follow him, you'd learn SO MUCH more. 3) VERY lenient grading; both midterms have 90+ avg/median. 4) You'll ENJOY his office hours. // Prof. Manion is truly inspirational. TAKE HIM IF YOU CAN.",
            "Great teacher, very passionate about the subject and is one of the few math professors I've had that is able to explain more complex concepts and even some proofs in a fashion that most undergraduates can understand. Wish I had this guy for every math class I took!",
            "Amazing teacher who makes clear the purpose of what you're learning as you learn it. If you're hoping for an easy A without really caring about the subject, he might not be the teacher for you. However, if you genuinely enjoy math, Andrew teaches in a way that makes math interesting, relevant, and sometimes roundabout but in hindsight, intuitive.",
            "Best teacher I've had in the subject of mathematics here at this institution of USC",
            "No weekly quizzes like most USC math classes. Prof. Manion is probably one of the best if not the best MATH225 professors to take. Whats on the exam actually matches what youve done in homework unlike other USC math classes."

            "Hassan is a mid professor. Super nice guy that means well but fools you when he grades your tests. 90% of your grade is exams and quizzes. Weekly quizzes are entirely to difficult. Not the worst I have ever had but very very mid.",
            "I want to give professor Hassan higher than a 3, I really really do.  I always felt like I understood the material well going into quizzes and then I would take them and the tests and I would barely pass.  He also would always say he cared about the students and he understood the class was hard but when it came time for grades he graded harshly.",
            "Excellent lecturer based primarily on examples, so I would highly recommend analyzing the pertinent textbook chapter to learn concepts before class. 2 exams (15% each) and a final exam (40%). 20 min quizzes can be tricky if concepts are not fully understood. 2 HWs/wk. Replaced lowest test with our final exam grade. Willing to help students.",
            "Overall Professor Hassan was great. During lectures we would work through so many example problems that ended up being really helpful for quizzes and exams. Overall his grading is really forgiving, he looks to make sure you understand the process and doesn't take off a lot of points for algebra mistakes. Course is graded off 90% tests and quizzes.",
            "Dr. Hassan taught the class well but his grading scale is awful. In the class there are 25 homework assignments and 12 quizzes worth 10% and 20%. There are two exams. The final is worth 40% of your grade and if you miss a test it will be added to the final. My final was worth 55% because I had the flu and was not allowed to make it up.",
            "This is a tough course, but Dr. Hassan teaches effectively, basing his lectures heavily on doing examples. Going to lectures is essential for succeeding in this class. Tests are very important, as there are only two and they make up a relatively large proportion of the final grade. He has weekly quizzes that normally are not bad if you are prepared",
            "Hassan is an average professor. Sometimes, the language barrier makes things hard to understand. This class is kinda dependent on using office hours or TA's, which I never do. If u really don't want to retake this course, get help early or find a friend. Statics is some bull, but it's def doable! Don't be discouraged! C's get degrees!!!",
            "Dr.Hassan is one who genuinely cares about his students' success. Statics is a difficult course to begin with but Dr.Hassan does a great job at explaining the material during lecture and clearly outlining and encouraging you to use resources if you're struggling. You definitely have work to do on your own, out of class, but would recommend Hassan.",
            "Dr. Hassan was amazing as a teacher at State, I have heard terrible things about Statics here, but he made it understandable. Sometimes, when short on time, the lectures can be fast-paced and there is a quiz every Thursday (not too bad if you study). Statics with Hassan is a must.",
            "Hassan saved me when it came to statics. He is a great professor and is very good at lecturing. He really wants his students to perform well and will go beyond what many professors at ncsu will do to ensure that his students not only understand the material but also get the help that they need. He should be your first choice for CE-214. WORK HARD!",
            "Lectures are fast-paced & sometimes confusing. His accent was understandable & he's willing to answer questions but you will need to go to office hours a lot if you want to do well in the class. Practice test is given for test 1 but not test 2. The 2nd test is graded very harshly as he expects you to understand the test 1 material fully & apply it.",
            "Accent is difficult, but he is very into helping his students but is a strict grader.  The weekly quizzes can bite back if you dint understand a specific part. But it is a ce class so just dont fall behind",

You figure out almost all of the class by yourself along with the other 15 hours you're taking at the same time. It's very tough to keep up with the quizzes. I'm taking it now over the summer and am on track for an A.",

The last exam + the cumulative final are combined and on the same day.",

There is not nearly enough time to complete exams that ask VERY specific questions about certain case studies (and you can't use your notes). He mainly talks about his own research.",

His study guides are not very helpful because there are things on his tests that were not even in the guide. If you have to take Ecology, take it in the fall if you want a better teacher and grade.",
            "He is a nice person and seems very passionate about what he is teaching. It is great that he posts skeletal lecture notes for you, but he adds in more details in class, so it is crucial to actually go to class. Unfortunately, he does not post any Powerpoints, so you are better off either asking classmates or looking at the textbook yourself.",

Also it deals with plants because they are essential to ecosystems and ecology.",

Do not take if you want an easy history credit because there are other sections for that. The class is discussion based so make sure your comfortable talking infront of others",
            "Readings and questions are assigned that are due at the beginning of each class. A few papers are assigned and he grades them harshly. If you do not like to talk a lot, I would not recommend this class because it is mostly discussion based. However, Professor Lechner is very knowledgeable with history and can answer many questions.",
            "He's awesome. A few papers and he's a tough grader, but go to him for guidance before anything's due and he's REALLY helpful. Gives the exam IDs/essay prompts beforehand. Reading questions due every class but he's flexible w how you answer them - just looks at them, you don't turn them in. Forces you to do the reading. Really funny and sarcastic"

The class is entirely graded by exams of which it's really hard to predict exactly what kinds of questions you need to prepare for. He constantly interjects the fact that all this information is \"common sense\" Genuinely Rude.",

He posts the quizzes and tests from previous years, which have similar questions to those you'll have. The textbook is key to survival, and his office hours are incredibly helpful in preparing for tests. His class is challenging, but if you work hard it'll be ok.",
            "Dr. Ison is not very clear whenever he lectures and whenever he does lecture he only does a couple of problems from the book. He expects the students to teach themselves using the problems from the book. The grade from the class comes from minor quizzes, major quizzes, and tests. Lots and lots of studying required.",
            "This class is a very independent class. The only grades you will receive will be from quizzes and tests. The class time isn't helpful, as Dr. Ison only goes over 2 (maybe 3) problems from the back of the book. All learning is done outside of class. He also doesn't go out of his way to tell you what exactly is going to be on said quizzes/tests.",

He often confuses students because he is never sure of his answers. He does not really care if the students pass or fail because he \"has his PhD\" and \"already made an A in the class.\"",
            "Dr. Ison doesn't teach clearly. He expects us to read the textbook and learn off of that instead of being taught in lecture. There are pre-lecture quizzes for every unit so be prepared to read the book. In each class, we only went through about 2 problems a day, and he often confuses himself going over those problmes. Avoid him if you can.",
            "Dr. Ison's class revolved around the textbook, and it was essential to read it if you hoped to do well on the pre-lecture quizzes, which are often long, where mere skimming the book won't help. Thankfully, they aren't worth much grade-wise. A couple things are taught only in lecture, and aren't in the book. A rigorous class for intro Chem majors.",
            "I dislike the CH 103 class itself. Students are supposed to teach themselves material and examples are done in class. Elon really just makes it worse. He sometimes cannot answer questions and so his go-to advice is  \"do every problem in the book\" (there's about 110 in every chapter). If you haven't taken AP chemistry try to take a lower level class",

            "I had Dr. Ison for basic chem specifically for chemistry majors. This class is hard. You have to read the chapter and take a quiz on it before he teaches it, and the tests are difficult. However, he gives you all the resources you need to be successful, and if you get through it, you'll have all the basics for the rest of your chemistry career.",
            "He gives quizzes before you go over the material but he goes over what he expects you to be able to do on the test. He teaches by example so be prepared to pay attention.",

            "He often seems to confuse himself when he's explaining concepts, so you have to wait for him to try at least 3 different models or definitions before he decides he's come up with the right one. His practice tests and quizes that he posts are sometimes misleading and often don't represent whats actually on the testquiz.",

Sweet man but he is unclear and confusing and nobody ever knows what is going on. You also leave the class without learning anything.",

He is an extremely impressive individual with a ton of career experience, but the class is boring, he's unclear, and you'll come out of it having learned nothing. This class is such a headache and nobody ever knows what's going on DONT DO IT",

He tends to ramble on about irrelevant material, he'll ask you questions about readings that aren't due yet, and he won't teach you anything about the subject. If you actually want to learn something about politics, don't take his class. Also 5 textbooks",
            "Professor Figgins can be monotone but he always adds in personal stories from his career that are hilarious. If you go to class on a semi regular basis and do the reading you will do fine on his tests. He lets you use your notes (or book sometimes) on the test, is an easy grader, and always curves the exam.",

Now by the end I find that it was really enjoyable - one of the most I took here. Professor Figgins is such a sweetheart and has so many good stories of his amazing career!",
            "Worst class I have ever taken! Dr. Figgins is very smart but makes absolutely no sense and expects you to read three textbooks. The class is graded based on how much you already know about foreign policy and how quickly you can flip through pages on the test.",
            "He is the sweetest old man.  He tries to make things interesting but sometimes is hard to do.  He give so many opportunities to get extra credit.  You have to read because that is where he gets the information from the test.  Attendance is taken every class.  He has so much experience its impressive.  I would highly recommend this class!",
            "Very sweet old man. He tries to make things clear but does not always do the best job, but has no problem answering questions. Classes can be boring and students have to give a case brief presentation but he is an easy grader. Curves tests which are open note. Very knowledgeable on the subject and has a million great stories about being a diplomat.",
            "Has a great background in the subject, but it is sadly not very good at teaching it. I came out of the class with an A- without ever having studied for any of the exams/quizzes, including the final. I also turned the huge paper in late, but still managed to get an A+ on that. He curves like crazy and goes easy on you if he likes you.",
            "I found Dr. Figgins to be engaging and extraordinarily knowledgeable in International Law. He has a rather fascinating history of employment with the UN. His grading is fair and his presentation of the topic is reasonably clear, concise, and scientific. He has strong political views but they don't affect his grading if you disagree.",
            "I really liked Dr. Figgins.  His classes are all lecture but the weekly quizes and exams are open books and open note!  Difficult tests but if you can read an index, you can find the answers.  Always helpful and understanding.  Lots of extra credit.",

His tests only have 6-8 questions that are worth a lot which makes it easy to do bad. Make sure to take notes from his lectures and do all the hw and you can easily get at least a B. Overall an ok professor.",
            "Castle doesn't really do much for this class, you basically learn everything by watching the videos and writing notes. Write down all the Webassign and practice tests to do well in this class. It is mainly graded off of the tests which only have 5-8 questions so if you miss one you're screwed. He is an ok professor but it is mainly self-learning.",
            "Overall I like Dr. Castle. He was very accessible and helpful outside class and taught the material well. The test grading criteria and explanations by him and his TA's was pretty unclear though that didn't ruin the class for me. I wouldn't say that the material is enjoyable but Dr. Castle is a solid professor and does care about students success.",
            "Professor gives very clear explanations of material. Recorded lectures are taught by a different person, thus topics can be varied in the way they are taught or presented in the HW. Luke is readily available for Office Hours, and easily makes confusing material understandable. Lots of HW initially, but gives less HW later on. Fast paced course.",
            "The professor is aware of online instruction's limited ability and does a great job of communicating the subject. If you take good notes, you can pass easily, especially since you can use your notes for exams. He makes many mistakes in his lectures but always gives annotated corrections; check those out! Use office hours to get good tips!",
            "I dont know why there are so many bad comments he is a great teacher. I enjoyed learning through his videos and he is really personable and extends deadlines often",
            "Dr. Castle in MA 114 was ok. I hate math and typically have to work harder at it, and I felt unsupported at times in this class. The grading was not always consistent for exams which was frustrating. Online homework can be confusing sometimes and also took some time to complete. Attending the Zoom lecture was useless, it rarely helped me.",
            "I'd wait and take the class later if it meant I could avoid Luke teaching it. I'm not good at math naturally, but I was able to get a solid A+ in calculus because I had a good professor. Luke and his TA's have unclear grading, don't know how to teach, and then get mad when students learn it elsewhere. Ridiculous. Avoid at all costs.",
            "If you take MA114 online. They make you watch Dr. Lavon page YouTube videos which are not helpful at all. I found myself learning the material by doing the homework by trial and error instead of watching the videos. The professor does not give any feedback or does not help. Terrible experience. Currently I have an A in the class.",
            "Lucas was a good calculus professor who knew the subject. He was very relaxed and enthusiastic about teaching. Make sure to be ready for the first exam as it can make or break your overall grade. Don't bother with the online textbook; get a copy of Stewart's Advanced Calculus to learn the course. The lectures were very proof-heavy with few examples",
            "Castle is a great guy, focuses on the math and teaches it in a way that is easily understandable. When he does go off on a tangent, it is usually a funny story about how he accidentally ROASTED a student that all you had to do was count to get the right answer. Very enjoyable would take again 10/10",
            "Castle is a great professor.  You learn a lot in class, definitely making it worth your time.",
            "Having Lucas as an instructor means you are going to learn a lot in the class. He emphasizes what is important and is constantly giving feedback. His tests are very straight forward with slightly tricky proof questions. The proof questions make for great thinking material and is exhilarating to solve.",
            "Although some people struggle with this class, he's always willing to help you. His exams are not hard, and he's not hard when grading. He's always joking",
            "Lucas Castle is a great teacher. The warm ups that are given every day are exactly like the test. As long as you do the online homework and the warmups you will do fine on the tests. He literally takes those questions and just changes the numbers.",
            "Professor Castle is a really good professor and cares that the students understand the material before moving on. He starts the lecture off by doing a warm up problem that goes over what he taught the previous class. He uses MyMathLabs and assigns a pretty large amount of homework off them.

Just make sure you choose to work with a really good group, or else it will be detrimental to your grade!!!!!",

            "Dr. Phillips was phenomenal. She is very knowledgeable about horses and wants all of her students to do well. If you study the lecture material and pay attention you will do well. You can reach her and/or TAs outside of class if you need extra help. All of the material was fun, well organized, and easy to follow. Shes one of my favorites!",
            "As a person with no horse experience I did not like this class. She teaches expecting you to understand basic horse things since 95% of the class has horse experience. She talks a lot about her own life and then will test you on it. Doesn't post the powerpoint online which is annoying and lecture isn't interesting. Tests are detailed.",
            "Dr. Phillips is great! I absolutely loved her class and passed with minimal previous horse knowledge. She really makes it easy to understand the material and will stay after class to answer any questions. Attending lectures is very helpful, because she doesn't post her lecture notes and she adds some info that isn't in the book.",
            "The class is designed with a lot of information, so it's a lot to take in, but she does it well. She uses games and videos to help you visualize what she's trying to teach you and loves to tell fun horse stories and jokes. She gives a pop quiz once almost every week, but is pretty good about \"hinting\" about when the quiz will be.",
            "Easy, Dr. Pratt Phillips is an awesome professor, she loves horses and therefore, this class. Makes the lectures really interesting and she is really passionate about the material, as long as you pay attention and check the book before the exams you should do great, but put some effort! she is extremely helpful and straight forward with the materia",
            "Dr. Pratt-Phillips is kind of socially awkward and not very nice when you go talk to her, even though she makes a point of having candy in her office. Her class is extremely biased towards hunter-jumper/eventing and the course material reflects the fact that she has no idea about any horse-related topic outside of that. But, it was a super easy A+!",
            "I enjoyed this class and Dr. Phillips' teaching. She uses power points, but is able to keep your attention. Also she plays videos which helps too! Pay attention to small things she says because it will come up on the test! Also pop quizzes almost every week. Easy 100 if you review notes though! The textbook is written by her and goes along w/ ppt"

She genuinely cares about her students and is so helpful in helping you become a better thinker and writer.",

She taught at UNC for almost a decade, there are only 4 papers, and every class is usually a class discussion.  She likes students who speak up in class.",

You will write in this class, 4 papers to be exact with no final exam. You will discuss the issues of language, rhetoric, feminism, and the effects of advertisements in society."

Also one paper 4-5 pages that was conversational about performances of Shakespeare.",

Beyond this, though, Dr. Crosbie is an extremely kind, caring, and understanding professor-- there was never a time where I felt that I couldn't come to him with any problems I had.",
            "Likable guy, very passionate about his subject and does a great job of conveying the excitement to his students. I came in not super interested in Shakespeare and came out almost ready to switch majors into English. Almost. The course/timeline was structured well. Medium length, open ended paper at the end but that's to be expected in English class",
            "I enjoyed the class somehow I feel like it would have been different if I was in a classroom I really don't like reading but managed to get a decent grade on my midterm ... Anyways we read a couple of plays and listen to lectures. Only 2 exams and one paper on a play of your choosing.",
            "Very nice/knowledgeable, lots of tangents, not exceptionally difficult if you show up and listen; doesn't always follow syllabus, said pop quizzes would be on the day reading was due no makeups but only gave 4/6 readings 2 a day or two late 1 with makeups others without; one reasonable final paper; midterm was easy final was harder but manageable",
            "Dr. Crosbie is super passionate and really wants his students to succeed. Pop quizzes on readings and two tests that are half quote identification and half short answer. You actually have to read, Sparknotes can only get you so far. He is really good at replying to emails and helping you in any way he can. Read the books and you will be fine.",

Few quizzes, 2 tests - a midterm and a final, 1 paper. Attendance helps with understanding plays and historical information for exams. Loves his job and not difficult at all. Take if you enjoy reading/have the time.",

It is Shakespearean literature, so the reading isn't always the easiest--but for a 400-level class, it's really laid back and the assignments are straightforward.

His tests are super easy as long as you can do the practice problems in the textbook. He always includes 5 points of extra credit on each test.",
            "When I took his class he was clearly new to teaching as a whole. Concepts were explained in an acceptable way, but nothing amazing. The TAs really did most of the work. He does not speak very loud, and he rushes through very difficult concepts before dialing back a bit once he sees the confusion on students faces. Not the worst, but not the best."

            "James is a fun lecturer and although I had this class first thing in the morning I was never bothered to wake up and get to class because the lectures were always fun and thought provoking. Out of class reading is usually light and enjoyable. I'd take this class again if I could.",
            "Go to class and keep up with the weekly readings and you'll be fine. He makes NC history super interesting and lecture is very engaging. In-class participation is required, but he makes it a lot of fun. Look no further if you need a good GEP class.",
            "I hated history in high school and dreaded taking this class, but Professor Wils is a vibrant and funny lecturer. The tests are take home which is great considering you get to use your book to find information and cite sources. Take this class you won't regret it.",

Along with the novels, is textbook chapter of reading (40 pages) a week. If you don't mind the reading and are a decent writer this class will be an easy A. 5 textbook pop quizzes throughout the class.",

He is good at lecturing and makes things interesting but you have to pay attention bc he is a tough grader. The class material was interesting and he's very chill. Not a lot of homework so just study for tests and you'll do fine.",
            "Professor Van Vleck is a very hard grader and provides little explanation of why points are lost. For a GEP, the course is challenging. There are no exams but weekly quizzes and forums are difficult to do well on. He expects you to be reading about 60-80 pages a week for his class or watch a 2.5-hour movie. He writes very passive-aggressive emails.",
            "Dr.V doesn't use slides so you have to take notes solely based on his lectures, however if you missed something you can listen to the class recordings. Your grades are mostly based on a final paper, a midterm, and the final. His tests are all short answer/essay so you have to memorize entire lectures. If you take good notes you'll do fine.",

            "He is an incredible story-teller and lecturer. He does not use slides or anything so all notes come from listening to his lectures, he does at least have recordings of his lectures in case you miss something. I enjoyed taking his class although it is quite difficult as your grade comes from a couple of assignments.",
            "Dr. Van Vleck is great. I took this class because it seemed like the least awful humanities option, and ended up liking it so much I took another of his classes as a free elective credit. \n\nHe knows that most people are just taking it for the GEP credit, but it's not an easy A. It's a little difficult, but fair. You need to take good notes.",
            "This class is extremely lecture heavy so you're going to rely on your notes. There are minimal assignments for this class which was nice throughout the semester because you didn't have a lot of work but you had to do well on what you did. He definitely knew his stuff and the material was interesting even if you're not that interested in history.",
            "I took HI 208 expecting a somewhat easy class, and that is DEFINITELY not what this class is. He does not have a presentation to take notes off of, you take notes simply by listening to his lectures which can be difficult to follow as he jumps from topic to topic. His tests are essay questions which means you have to memorize all of your notes.",
            "I was extremely misled by the other reviews of this professor. He was extremely unprofessional, often showing up late to class, and appeared to put little effort into his lectures. He was unnecessarily cruel and rude with comments on an assignment. The exams are all essay/short answer questions and require hours of studying to make at least a C.",
            "Out of all the professors teaching HI 208 at NCSU, this professor is probably your best choice. However, he doesn't give many assignments so don't skip one. The book for his term paper wasn't available on Wolfpack Outfitters either. His lectures are pretty interesting, but he doesn't allow notetaking on electronic devices so be ready to write.",
            "An amazing professor you'll be lucky to get. He's devoted to the history he teaches and is there to share that joy with you. His lectures are detailed, funny, and told like a story that will really encapsulate you the whole time. No memorizing names, ugly slides, and no textbook. Have fun laughing and learning about people from the past. Ciao.",
            "Dr. V is a fantastic professor. He may seem intimidating at first, but you can tell he's knowledgeable and passionate about what he teaches. Extremely lecture-heavy, but decent note-taking skills will bring you far. I would definitely recommend taking him to fulfill a GEP.",
            "I had his class once a week from 6 to 930 Tuesday night. Though it was a long and late class he was able to keep me focused and very interested the whole time. He rekindled my love for history by making it come to life before my eyes. What an amazing teacher!",
            "Never take this guy! Grades way too difficult for a 200 level history class. If you make more than 3-4 grammar mistakes on your term paper he automatically gives you a C. Took as an elective and its interesting content, too bad he ruined it for me. I feel like he sets his students up for failure. First time I've felt like this and I'm a senior."

She may not reply to your email on time. Besides that, Dr. Qaqish is a kind, understanding professor.",

Don't bother getting the textbook though I never used it.",

Just reiterate what he states.",

The text book did not seem to be crucial to success, but online readings are. 2 quizzes/1paper worth 20% of grade each and final that was 40%..but not really cumulative",

            "This guy is a genius and far outweighs any expectation I had for an intro film professor. Anyone complaining or calling him rude are lackluster students who do not want to be challenged .This guy sheds light on the parts of the industry that people refuse to talk about. A proper lad who doesn't like time wasters.",
            "TJ is HORRIBLE. I took this class spring semester and it was the biggest pain EVER. Not only is he incredibly rude & condescending, but the level of work for this class is far beyond \"intro\". His lectures are just his personal vendettas about the world, and he plays favorites based on students who want to be just like him. NEVER responds to emails",
            "TJ is very sarcastic and condescending. I dropped his class because I could not take another boring lecture that was full of useless information. His class is very long and boring, and he is very full of himself and negative at times. I would not recommend this class to anyone who is not already educated about film.",
            "Don't take this for an easy A. Take this if you love films and want to leave a better film analyst. I didn't mind his rudeness because of how many absolute idiots were there. Pretentious level 100 but interesting lectures. He likes and is willing to help the students who really care. Talk to him after class if you want to be one of those students.",
            "The class itself isn't terribly work heavy, and the work you do have to, usually, is pretty basic. The film journals are easy 100's, however, the essays are graded roughly and the finals can include stuff not gone over in class since Volgare often strays in his lectures and goes off on random tangents.",
            "Movies were interesting but lectures were AWFUL! He made no sense and constantly got off topic. PPT slides are not helpful at all. He seems like a nice guy truly, but his mandatory attendance policy is ridiculous and he lectures like we are all award winning filmmakers who are there to brush up on our skills.",
            "He forgets that he is the only film expert in the room. Journals are easy and films are interesting but his lectures are long and boring with a lot of tangents and he's not interactive with the students. You need the textbook to reteach yourself all the vocab/concepts. Dont take this expecting it to be beginners, you def need background film info",
            "Hes obviously passionate about film, but not about teaching. The assignments were written in a convoluted and nebulous manner, and it was hard to know what he wanted. The lectures were long-winded, and full of unimportant info. Take it only if you want a class where you watch movies half the time and/or already know a lot about film.",
            "You should only take T. J. if you're interested in film-making. T. J. himself is very passionate about what he does. Not only is he a professor, but a film director, pastor, and has a band. I talked to him personally on multiple occasions, and he gave me multiple opportunities and pointers. Go and talk to him after class, you'll love him.",
            "The movies we watched were interesting and varied and TJ is very passionate and knowledgable about film, but I will admit some of his lectures could be long and boring with lots of irrelevant info. We only had to write two essays, but they were long and graded a bit harshly. The exams consist of multiple choice, fill in the blank, and short essays.",
            "The topic was interesting, but Volgare made it very hard to enjoy the subject matter. He was extremely unclear on what he wanted done for assignments as well as important information that should have been on the syllabus. On top of this, he had a lot of snarky comments that came off as rude and unhelpful.",
            "Volgare could of made the class a lot easier, be wary of the amount of papers he makes you write. Mentioned also, he gave out the wrong final exam time in the syllabus. Not a good professor to take, PowerPoint slides are amazingly long, and dull. He expects you to know Film terminology. It really sucks.",
            "Volgare decided it was a good idea to not update his syllabus with the correct final exam time. Also, the amount of dumb papers in this clas is laughable. Dont take him.",
            "Professor Volgare had the opportunity to be a very good professor, but ultimately was the worst grader and not clear on his writing assignments. His attendance policy (missing one class and bump half a letter grade) is insane and not explained. Could of been a super easy course, but he assigned reading and writing assignments that were dull."

He gives you everything you need to know for the test and Quia is really important for your grade. He's definitely passionate about Spanish which helps you learn more. I recommend him over other teachers I've had here.",

Turns out other professors for this section gave their students a final study guide and he didn't. The study guide matched the exam, and Cox didn't prepare us well. Not a great class.",

She is in way over her head even more with online classes. Don't risk your GPA and waste a semester!",
            "Where to start? & in 350 char? Extremely unorganized in moodle and grading. As others say, her interpretation is the only correct one. Her guides are the only way to pass, she gives examples in class but she doesn't remember anything so you can lose points. Expects PhD-level work. You have to ASK for feedback but she expects perfect grammar. Crazy.",
            "Professor Mykyta is very vague in her lectures and very unclear on subject matters. The first 2/3 of the semester consisted of religious texts and the last bit were interesting poems. Its important to take notes and implement them in your papers if you want a good grade. The final consisted of 2 papers to write, which I did enjoy.",

The class is all lecture and reading, the subject is interesting and she enjoys it, but she expects you to participate in class discussion and she is particular about the papers. Still a passable and interesting class.",
            "1. graded papers on select few things she was looking for but didn't specify what those things were; this was a problem when you wrote about facets of a long text but she was looking for 1 or 2 /specific/ facets and wanted you to read her mind.  2. Extremely rude; told people they were wrong in class for giving their interpretation of a text???",
            "Sweet teacher. Super lecture heavy and participation really matters... People that spoke in class and contributed to discussions made higher grades than others. She's a super particular grader on papers and takes off for stylistic things. Ended up with an A somehow but spoke in the class a ton so I think that helped! A few papers here and there",
            "Professor Mykyta is one of the nicest professors I have been able to have taken at NCSU. She gives you 3 total papers, 2 small ones (2 pages each) for 15% of your grade. Which hardly anyone gets lower than a B, One midterm that is all written (semi-difficult), and a Final paper (4 pages total).  Participate, let her know your name and you'll ace it",
            "She is not organized at all and never follows the syllabus. Almost always late to class and sometimes does not show up at all. She expects a lot from us without ever telling us what she wants. Asks confusing questions and judges answers harshly. I would say save yourself the trouble and avoid this class. It is basically unbearable.",
            "She obviously loves her subject but is really not that great at teaching it. She rarely sticks to the syllabus but expects you to follow it to the very confusing letter. Her questions and assignments are never very clear and there have been times when everyone in my class turned in something completely different because nobody understood her.",
            "The class goes at a pace of about a poem per class, so it's vital to have done the reading if you want to know what she's talking about. She doesn't go too in-depth in terms of analysis and gives a good general overview. Is very clear about what she expects in papers. Not hard as long as you have some idea of basic literary analysis.",
            "She grades tough on essays and looks for specific answers so if you write down exactly what she says it's gold. Also participate in class and she will love you, but if you say the wrong thing (which is very likely because her questions are confusing) then she will bring you down.",
            "She doesn't understand technology and she is down right rude. Even when the students who try really hard in class try to ask her questions she snaps at them and makes some snide remark. She mis-graded one of my tests by 10 points. She DOES NOT respond to emails. Ever. She doesn't teach the french in class, she expects you to know it already",
            "Terrible. Often unclear during lectures, syllabus was basically a blank slate that changed continuously. Assignment due dates were often unclear, and she is technologically incompetent. Be prepared to be frustrated (Expect to receive many poorly formatted, mis-scanned, etc. files of readings in emails). The content was generally solid, however."

He's fairly clear on what material will be on the test.,but I honestly felt blindsided by some test questions based on how much (or how little) he discussed the material in class. Examples were sometimes very complicated and/or poorly explained. The textbook isn't required, but it's nice to have for practice.",

            "Professor Mcleod was decent, most of my learning came from the textbook (zybook). He did some examples in class that I would pay attention to and write down.  The tests are fairly challenging and graded strictly by the TAs, who are sometimes wrong and you can dispute your grade for credit back. Do zybooks and practice tests and you'll be good.",
            "Dr. McLeod is a decent teacher, but it's clear he came from a university where he wasn't asked many questions. Oftentimes, lecture materials were not well prepared before class, and TopHat question answers were often wrong: he had to revise in class. He didn't always know why things were true, and this was evident. It is an easy class though.",
            "The labs make up most of the class but only a small amount of the grade. He is a very fair professor who tries his best and I think is decent at teaching. I would recommend starting projects early and definitely utilizing office hours, they make a big difference. The tests were a little rough, pay attention to what he says in the test review.",
            "The professor only lectured and used some code implementations. This review is for CSC-216. The tests were fairly hard and there were no review sessions by the professor and absolutely no review material. The way they ask us to review for the final is very vague. They don't tell us what is on the final and the format. Nothing was provided. Avoid!",
            "Dr. McLeod is great. He's really transparent about everything and gives a lot of opportunities in class to ask questions about anything. Pre-class assignments are required and help a lot. Tests can be hard, but he does a good job of making sure you know what to be ready for. Class structure itself has its issues, but he is awesome.",
            "I thought his class was well taught and he tries his best to make sure students understand the material. I felt like his teaching style was easy to understand and helped simplify complex topics. Tests were graded really really slow, but he has a great grading policy overall for the class.",
            "Professor McLeod is an amazing professor. He is super understanding and always gives extensions if you need them. His lectures are great and the class really isn't too difficult if you try. There is always extra credit on the tests and you get to retake your lowest test grade at the end, so I would definitely recommend taking him for discrete math.",
            "Dr. McLeod is a good guy, he taught the class well. There was extra credit on the tests, and you could retake your lowest test during the final exam period. Pretty straightforward class, you will be fine taking either Dr. McLeod or Dr. Card."

If you make a fatal error on the test, he will usually correct you, so you don't bomb the question. Homework is fairly straightforward, all of it is due the day before the test.

He gives extensions on WebAssign. Super nice guy. Responds super quick to emails. He is super smart with double PHD (4.0 both times). Lectures are textbook based which can get boring",

Fall '23 was his first semester teaching at NC State. He memorized our classes names and faces within the first exam. He is so caring, and it's obvious he loves teaching. I wish I could take his class again.",
            "Very caring and understanding professor.  Although the lectures can be a bit mundane due to them being content straight from the textbook, he did a great job about answering questions and incorporating outside material to make them interesting.  Also very accessible outside of class and it's apparent that he's looking to help students succeed!",
            "Arsen is very kind and caring and wants you to succeed in his class. Will help you if you just ask. However, his lectures are straight out of the textbook and sometimes confusing though he will try and explain better if you ask. The homework is often very hard, but the tests are much easier. No curves and no extra credit.",
            "Dr Iskhakov is very sweet and understanding. He genuinely cares for his students and wants them to understand the material and do well in the class. My only complaint is that his lecture is very textbook guided and is mostly just him writing on the board but when asked for clarification he is very helpful. I would take again."

I often looked back at the Wiley Plus homework before the tests and did it all again while making sure I knew what was going on and how to apply it. Doing this I was able to get 90+ on every test. It's a hard class, but he's a super cool guy and I loved attending the lectures.",
            "I now understand why the physics dept. is lacking here at NCSU. He barely used slides or did examples and when he lectured it was very sporadic and just wrote on the board. Also, at least this semester every single test was curved with one having a 63% average, and in the end the final wasn't even curved. Take it at community college.",
            "Dr. Bochinski was a nice guy and he clearly wanted his students to succeed and not place too much pressure on themselves for tests. I struggled with his lecture style as there weren't any slides so it was a little hard to follow. Tests are standardized in the physics department so I would supplement his lectures with those from other profs",

I found the tests to be somewhat easier than the homework, but definitely put in the effort to study - he posts a practice test for each test, and those helped me a lot. Good professor, just be aware it'll be a lot of work if you want to do well!",
            "Overall good teacher if a bit awkward in lecture; his tests are tricky and the material really has to have \"clicked\" with you in order to do well. A few questions on each test are designed to trick you but most of them are ok if you know the material well. Not an easy A by any means but not impossible as long as the material clicks.",

He always said things were easy whenever we'd go over the exam questions that everyone basically bombed, which made us feel dumb. I repeat do not take over the summer you will be crushed academically and emotional",
            "Took this class during the summer. It was tough because the material was rushed, but then all summer classes are. Once you learn how he tests, the class is pretty easy.

I think the main con with him is that he's not very enthusiastic about the material, and it shows in lecture. Tests are pretty difficult as well: some of the questions he gives are just trick questions. Overall, not bad.",
            "Jason is a really cool guy, but not a great teacher. I can tell that he's trying to engage his students but he's just boring. His test aren't a good representation of what you learn in class and he always seems to run out of time. He doesn't understands what students struggle with, and seems to think physics is trivial. I took honors.",
            "He was a cool guy and a good teacher but it's like he doesn't understand the concept of \"hard.\" His webassigns and exams were just ridiculously hard and he would always say they were easy. I'm a relatively smart/hardworking student and I still had to go to tutoring every day to pass this class.",
            "No Comments",
            "Good guy, the only reason why his class is hard is that the material is very boring. He doesn't look like he likes teaching it and I don't blame him. The way webassign is set up is ridiculous it is a real pain. The format of this class is more to blame than the teacher.",
            "The class started out with 90 kids. In the end only 50 kids remained in the class. He's not mean, just really hard. There are easier PY 212 teachers that teach well and test fairly. Though, I do know that some people were able to do very well."

            "Dr. Wiley is a great guy! I had to miss a bunch of classes and he was more than understanding. However, get ready to do a TON of work. All reading and lecture notes are graded, along with weekly reflections, 3 individual projects, and a huge group project with mandatory Moodle postings every week. Its mandatory for COM majors, but just a heads up!",
            "Prof Wiley is a good teacher and a great guy it just sucked that his class was terribly boring. Attendance was't mandatory but he grades your notes so keeping up with that is challenging. The journal checks were easy but took a lot of time and felt so unnecessary. Easy class if you stay on top of your work but just boring.",
            "Professor Wiley's class requires an immense amount of work; I don't think I've ever taken a class that has required as much writing as this one. I went through the ink of three pens just on one journal check and experiment. Other than this, Professor Wiley does a great job of keeping students engaged in the classroom and the material is interesting",
            "Terrible experience, definitely wouldn't take again. Makes you take notes in his format and takes off points on journal checks if they're not up to his standards. Journals also take forever. Also the format of the class is just generally boring.",
            "Great professor. He's very patient while discussing the difficult concepts in the class, and he took an extra week in our class to highlight a difficult concept to make sure we were all on board. It's clear that he knows what he's talking about, and it shows in his expectations. The grading is fairly difficult, but not unfair.",

He challenged his students, but given his thorough understanding of the topic and difficulty, he made sure we had the opportunity to ask questions when needed. He offered time in class for us to discuss among our peers or with him, and these times helped me thoroughly. Would take again.",
            "He's an alright instructor.  He'll call you out in an online lecture if no one talks, so be sure to pay attention during the Blackboard sections.  His grading scale is kind of weird and he's super specific with what he expects.  Try to have him grade it rather than the teaching assistant.  Overall, it's okay, but I'd take other 400 levels first.",
            "I am currently in the guinea pig class for the Qualitative Research Methods class and so far its been a really good class. He asks you to do alot of reading online and throughout 2 books (some of the articles he gives you are very challenging) but we always go over it in class and if you study then its easy to make a decent grade on the tests",
            "Excellent prof. Not easy, but not unreasonable. You will be required to do a great deal of reading of pdf docs - stay on top of the reading and be prepared to discuss in class. He is flexible in how you address class projects, so take the opportunity to be creative :-)",
            "I took the [Communication and Globalization] class with Dr. Wiley over the summer. Great professor! Very interesting class, and the readings/work connect the themes of the class well. A lot of reading and participation required. It's worth it though.....",
            "Very good professor. Nice too. No book needed but pretty hard electronic readings. He does, however, explain the material to help your understanding. Participation in the class is mandatory. If you don't volunteer, you will be called on. Be prepared for discussion."

            "Easy A. Lectures aren't the most informative but homework is virtually all of your grade and Miller is an easy grader. No final exam, just an online certification which is also a positive.",
            "Miller is a very nice, caring dude and this class is literally an easy A. He cares about his students and gave extensions when I was experiencing grief during this semester.",
            "Miller is a really nice guy. He is also very understanding if you have to miss classes. You won't be graded on much, just do all your projects and any other assignments and it is legit an easy A+. This class is basically about learning how to use materials and being creative and as long as you try, you are all set.",
            "Miller's TDE 110 class was the easiest class I had sophomore year.  He makes the class about actually learning the material and not about a certain grade.  He is one of the few professors that doesn't just say he cares about you, he actually shows it.",
            "Dr. Miller is an amazing professor and cares a lot about what he is doing. He always wants to make sure students are getting the most out of class and wants everyone to succeed. He is very forgiving and understanding when it comes to assignments. If I could take him for every class I would",
            "Great at teaching hands-on machine work, gentle criticism and always making sure you understand the best practices and how to be safe around the machines. Big story-teller and endearing man that wants to connect with his students. Not so great at being clear on the written assignments but is very easy going and forgiving with everything.",
            "Miller is a nice guy but how he ended up teaching this course is beyond me. I took this class spring 2020 and he had no clue what he was doing. He even told us repeatedly to forgive him because he was new. The homework and content is simple enough, I wish I had taken it with a professor who had more of a clue, class just seemed pointless with him.",
            "I like Dr. Miller. Hes a nice person, super respectful and he understand graphics communication well. The problem is, he doesnt really have any experience with solidworks. He used the program less than 5 times in class over the entire semester and I felt like I had to teach myself solidworks all on my own. He should get better as time passes.",
            "Dr. Miller was a great professor! He was very passionate about what he was teaching (almost too much). He is very understanding, and is willing to help out his students in any capacity he can. He gave great tips, and this class is a pretty easy A if you put in any effort. I definitely didn't spend too much time outside of class. Would recommend!"

Her tests are insane, the problems are Tensor and Geometry, forget the subject. It's very easy to get discouraged with this professor. It takes 3 hrs to go through one of her classes bc her English is tedious to understand.",
            "Super thorough lectures, very fair exams, good homework. She's also funny and respectful. Only downfall is that she LOVES to call on students during class using the roster but she's not critical if you get it wrong. Lecture attendance is \"mandatory\" simply by doing in-class activities that are a part of class. Very much would recommend for solids 2",

She has a great sense of humor that makes learning Solids 2 enjoyable and engaging.",

            "Be ready to work QUICKLY. Dr Huang is very smart and she knows the material well, but she essentially expects mastery in class activities. She has the solution right in front of her and expects you to be solving it more quickly than she's writing it up on the board. Very long HW problems with no partial credit for process (70% just for submitting)",
            "A thorough and good professor. The only class this year that I didn't have to worry about cramming or teaching myself outside of class, because I actually learned (wow!). She tries to keep all of the learning within class time, homeworks are actually what we learned in class. Gotta pay attention tho, attendance matters - random TopHat questions.",
            "Best professor at NCSU that I had all 4 years!  Her teaching style lets you work a lot of problems in class and she is the most organized professor in MAE always prepared for class.  I think the other people that rated her poorly just put in little effort.   If it weren't for her I wouldn't have gone to grad school.",
            "She grades in such a way to make sure the average is low. She does not grade consistently between students. Homework and class examples are overly simplified compared to the test. She will take off a ridiculous amount of points for a small mistake. Avoid at all costs.",
            "She takes off way to much for making a silly mistake on a test. Basically, if you take the derivative of sine wrong and say its -cosine, then she will take off over half your points"

Took me a while to catch on to his teaching style but he is a fantastic teacher",

I found his Mathematical Foundations of Data Science class to be rather challenging--not because of the math, but because of the coding skills necessary to succeed in the class. If you are good with MATLAB and have prior coding experience, you should have no issue in this class. Super caring and clear prof.",
            "Prof. Haider has been my favorite Calculus professor by far. He gives you adequate time to complete the homeworks and gives practice tests that are very similar to the real tests. He really cares for his students and teaches very well and indepth. While the tests are somewhat difficult, Haider is very lenient with curving. Definitely recommend.",
            "I went into calc 3 having gotten a 4 on the BC calc exam and I've gotten above a 100 on all the tests so far. He gives practice exams before the test that are EXACTLY like the real thing and gives cheat sheets and a curve. Lectures are pretty good. He is very understanding about student/social life and has even canceled classes to give breaks.",
            "Dr. Haider is the best option at NC State for MA 401. He's VERY clear, organized, and easy to follow, and explain things well. His tests are exactly like the practice tests and he's a pretty lenient grader. I suck at differential equations and he was my savior. I would recommend him 10/10.",
            "The class starts easy but gets hard quickly after the first exam. Homework is harder than lecture examples but is close to the exams. Dr. Haider also has practice exams that are like the real exams, however, he makes up completely new scenarios for them, so paying attention in class and understanding the materials is very important.",
            "Dr. Haider is one of the best math professors at State. The material is tough but rather intuitive and he explains it thoroughly. As long as you do the homework and understand what your doing, you will do well.",
            "He can be confusing but will help out in office hours. Tests aren't bad, he reviews really well. Final exam was really tough. Points are taken off for minor details.",
            "Great professor, extremely organized.  His reviews are exactly like the test.  Be careful on test though, points are taken off for even minor things.",
            "Excellent teacher.  Very strong explanations for everything, never took attendance, graded hw on completion, tests were explained in advance and not tricky, just tested to see if you knew the material or not.  It doesn't get much better."

He was super easy to reach, caring and accommodating!",

All in all he's probably one of the best professors I've had.",

Huge amount of material and super long homeworks, though. Textbook is useful in this class to figure out what he is trying to convey; it's a linear algebra class in disguise.",

Oh and a project that I'm pretty sure he just gives everyone 100 on. The class was so dry I couldn't pay attention and the tests are ALL memorization so I kinda sucked at them.",

Be mentally prepared for a truckload of assignments; sometimes, nonetheless, he provides 100% extra credit if the homeworks are convoluted. His exams are easy if you work on the assignments.",

His homework is noticeably harder than the examples he gives, and he doesn't give very many. His tests (there's only one midterm) aren't too bad, however. The homework helps you prep for it, and the practice test is very similar.",
            "Lectures were boring and contained few relevant examples. Homeworks were long and much more complicated than examples in class or in the notes. Tests were very fair. You will probably pass, but you won't learn very much unless you do a lot of work on your own outside of class.",

I recommend typing down all of the bold face words, definitions, and main concepts on a Word document after each class from the powerpoint lectures. This will probably minimize studying down to about 4 hours before the test.",
            "Abides very strictly by school attendance policy. Lectures are clear and concise and provides great study notes (as long as you pay attention; notes are fill in the blank!. Good teacher but could focus on teaching essential concepts rather than facts. Manageable workload in class. Show up, participate and study the lecture notes and you'll be fine.",

            "Tiffany is a great instructor and I would definitely recommend taking one of her courses. She keeps class interesting with  partner/group assignments (usually only based on participation, not correctness), and raises open-ended questions that promote class discussion. This helps the class period fly by and it's easier to pay attention.",
            "Technically a TA/Grad student, classes with her were boring lectures where she read completely off the slides. If it weren't for the \"random participation\" points then I imagine attendance would be poor. Do not take a class with her unless you like powerpoint-focused classes."

Do beware of pop quizzes, which means you have to show up to class even though the lectures are a rehash of the assigned readings. Study the homework problems she points out before the test and you'll be just fine."

We also took a really fun trip to climb outdoors, it was a great experience!",

I cannot recommend this class enough!",

Just go to class and participate and you will be fine. I took it P/F, but if you can do a 3 minute plank and a 1.5 mile in under 13 minutes then it will be an easy A.",

There was a gym lab sometimes every week but often they were more spaced out, a midterm (that if you take pass/fail you only need to get a 70), and a final (walk/run 1.5 miles). I recommend it highly.",

Probably the nicest professor I've had, and she cancelled classes 3-4 times a month. She could be a little confusing at times, but she never got upset if you didn't understand how to do something.",

One day yoga, another day lifting in the weight room, another day a nature walk. She's super positive and enthusiastic to be at state (as this was her first semester here).

            "Although he may be good for other ECE courses, ECE411 wasn't worth it. Spent too many hours on HW (+weekends) but I don't feel like I got anything out of it. The expectations for the term project were unclear. Soul crushing. I tried to give him every benefit-of-the-doubt :( He is very passionate, and it shows in lecture, but this was unreasonable.",
            "Decent prof, but damn only take ECE411 if you're really interested in the meat of ML. It's a tough class. Very math heavy, but Dr. Wong explains these pretty well, just don't be surprised. Final Project also kinda hits hard, but the rest of the class is consistent with HWs that have extra credit in them. Prepare to spend hours on HW and studying.",
            "Really good guy, overall very sweet/wholesome. Definitely take him if you have to take 301. He lets you bring a cheat sheet into the tests and the tests are pretty much carbon copies of the previous year's tests (which he gives you) which makes tests a breeze. There is a decent amount of HW but he gives extra credit on pretty much every single one."

However, he is a very kind person and means well.",

She's super understanding and if it's hard for you to learn, she will spend time with you to help you understand without judgement. She provides great feedback and is just an all around amazing teacher. Homework isn't bad for language class, quizzes there to help raise your grade",
            "She's not my professor, but she's one of my favorite teacher assistants. She's very kind, funny, patient, & can relate to her students. When she sees frustration, she breaks it down, doesn't judge you & or look down on you. She grades fairly. My only con about her is she's very inflexible w/her office time. What's on the syllabus is all you get."

She is very critical and makes comments on every little thing that you do wrong even if you have a period out of place."

No multiple choice exams just small projects.",

It is a descent amount of reading, but you can get away with skimming or reading after class as most material is covered during lectures. Interesting and engaging lectures. Very low stakes grading and extra credit opportunities. Take her if you can!"
